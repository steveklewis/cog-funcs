# Introverted Sensing - Concrete Thinking

"What is concrete thinking? It is thought where there is also one who thinks, and a definite something (in the sense of 'particular') that is thought, where existence gives the existing thinker thought, time, and space." - Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript

## The Basis of Experience

In the most abstract explanation, the category of Introverted Sensing contains everything that has existed. Its orientation is primarily towards the past, because it defines actuality. Given all of the possibilities that could occur, Introverted Sensing makes up those possibilities that end up becoming real. It grounds in a relation to what is concrete and material.

## The Feeling of What Happens

Bringing it back to something less abstract, Introverted Sensing is what you know, concretely. It's the full set of experiences you've lived, through your entire life. You've walked on the concrete stage of Extraverted Sensing your whole life, and so you have to absorb a set of knowledge from the experiences you've had. Introverted Sensing is what you know, particularly, about particular places and particular times. It's not about the abstractions or the lessons learned from all the mistakes you've made. It's what you felt, what you saw, what you heard, what you tasted.

This attention that we have towards the things that are actual allows us to accomplish goals in the real world. Without some sort of attention to the theater of the concrete world (Se) and the things that occur on that theater (Si), we cannot make real any of our plans or intentions constructed in the theater of the abstract world (Ne).

## The Artifacts of Software Development

Why does this matter to the life of software development? Well, partly, we get to know the codebases that we spend time with. We see all of it nooks and crannies, and we get more adept at changing it, fixing it, accepting its limitations, but trying to push it forward as a successful project.

> The internal sense, by means of which the mind contemplates itself or its internal state, gives, indeed, no intuition of the soul as an object; yet there is nevertheless a determinate form, under which alone the contemplation of our internal state is possible, so that all which relates to the inward determinations of the mind is represented in relations of time. (CPR, Of Space, Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception)
