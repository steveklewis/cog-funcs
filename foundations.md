* The Theoretical Foundations of Cognitive Functions

Several months ago, I made a post to my friends that I was going to create a course that applied Cognitive Functions to the sphere of programming. I would call it something like, "Cognitive Functions for Programmers." I have not made good on that promise, but I feel that I have made progress in getting the fundamentals right. There are two aspects that I believe I have fully fleshed out. The first is a matrix that diagrams the relationship of each cognitive function to the primary theoretical categories Kant uses in "The Critique of Pure Reason." The second is an explanation of Cognitive Functions as functions, using syntax that would be familiar to any programmer.

Going forward from this will be an explanation of each Cognitive Function, with examples and connections to the theoretical foundations, as well as an explanation, with examples of the relationships between the cognitive functions. This pursuit will be made much easier by having spent so much time on the theoretical foundations.
