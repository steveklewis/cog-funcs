# The Theoretical Foundations of Cognitive Functions

Several months ago, I made a post to my friends that I was going to create a course that applied Cognitive Functions to the sphere of programming. I would call it something like, "Cognitive Functions for Programmers." I have not made good on that promise, but I feel that I have made progress in getting the fundamentals right. There are two aspects that I believe I have fully fleshed out. The first is a matrix that diagrams the relationship of each cognitive function to the primary theoretical categories Kant uses in "The Critique of Pure Reason." The second is an explanation of Cognitive Functions as functions, using syntax that would be familiar to any programmer.

Going forward from this will be an explanation of each Cognitive Function, with examples and connections to the theoretical foundations, as well as an explanation, with examples of the relationships between the cognitive functions. This pursuit will be made much easier by having spent so much time on the theoretical foundations. One of the things I got wrong in my first attempts to define the cognitive functions is an approach that was too abstract, and not properly grounded in the historical distinctions laid out by Immanuel Kant. There are so many abstractions that can be brought forward when thinking about Cognitive Functions, but the hard part is to find the most relevant and the most explanatory. We want to find the right abstractions, so that they can change the way we see the world and most effectively build a fence around each Cognitive Function.

To that end, please read these two sections that make up the Theoretical Foundations of Cognitive Functions. I have worked hard to make my explanations both simple and clear. I am proud of the effort I have put into them both:

* [The Kantian Matrix For Cognitive Functions](matrix.md)

* [Cognitive Functions Are Functional](cog_funcs_are_functional.md)
