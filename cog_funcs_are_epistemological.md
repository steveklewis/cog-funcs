* Cognitive Functions Are Epistemological

While Cognitive Functions are dualistic,   Cognitive Functions have a metaphysics, borrowed from Plato and other dualistic philosophies, but Cognitive Functions constitute an epistemology. Cognitive Functions are interesting, not so much for the metaphysical basis on which they are founded, but because the perspective they take, which is fundamentally epistemological.



Cognitive Functions don't tell you about how the world is. They also don't tell you about how the world ought to be. They do tell you about what you can know and how you can know. That makes Cognitive Functions epistemological.

But even before we can know something, we have to pay attention to that something. Cognitive Functions tell us the patterns of our attentional habits, what we pay attention to, and what we don't pay any attention to.
