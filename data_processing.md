# Cognitive Functions as Data Processing

## Cognitive Functions as a Data-Processing Pipeline

Software programmers are very familiar with data-processing. We deal with inputs and outputs and functions all day. Cognitive Functions can be described as a data-processing pipeline for your mind. We attend to different outside inputs, we sort through those inputs, we store those inputs for future use, and we retrieve what we've stored as we use them for future use.

Data Input (Ne/Se) -> Sorting (Ti/Fi) -> Storage (Ni/Si) -> Data Retrieval (Fe/Te)

### Data Input

If we don't get the correct data input, we won't be able to accomplish our goals. As individuals, and as teams, we need to make sure we're looking at the correct data. If not, we'll be using old our irrelevant data to the task at hand.

### Sorting the Data

If we don't spend time to sort through the new data, it will be almost impossible to retrieve it for later use. As individuals, and as teams, if we're not taking the time to accurately judge the data coming in, we will make bad decisions and will waste time that we probably don't have.

### Storing the Data

Now that we've got the data sorted, we have to store it in the right places. Without good access to our data, we'll retrieve the wrong kind of data, and get something that's too abstract, or too concrete, to help with the task at hand. As individuals, and as teams, if we're not taking the time to understand what kind of information the situation calls for, we won't be effective.

### Retrieving the Data

Retrieving the data is important because without this piece we won't be able to act intelligently, with a fully-informed mindset. We will make decisions in a fog. There will be information useful to us, but we won't be able to access it.


## Don't Skip an Element in Your Pipeline

These things sound trivial, and feel trite and overly-simplistic, but without attention to each step, you as an individual or your team will get stuck on one of these. I've seen it happen all the time in my career. Someone forgot to look at something, or communicate something, or someone implemented the wrong thing. Many individuals and teams end up making the wrong decisions or stumbling over the same problems. But it's important to analyze why, because the symptoms might be similar, but the root cause might be different, and you or your team may be overlooking the specific root cause.

Attend to your data-processing pipeline. Make sure your team isn't overlooking an element in the pipeline.
