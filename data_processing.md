# Cognitive Functions as Data Processing

## Cognitive Functions as a Data-Processing Pipeline

Software programmers are very familiar with data-processing. We deal with inputs and outputs and functions all day. Cognitive Functions can be described as a data-processing pipeline for your mind. We attend to different outside inputs, we sort through those inputs, we store those inputs for future use, and we retrieve what we've stored as we use them for future use. At any point in the pipeline, something could go wrong. There are multiple points of failure, and we're only as reliable as our weakest element in the pipeline.

Data Input (Extraverted Perception - Ne/Se) -> Sorting (Introverted Judging - Ti/Fi) -> Storage (Introverted Perception - Ni/Si) -> Data Retrieval (Extraverted Judging - Fe/Te)

### Data Input

If we don't get the correct data input, we won't be able to accomplish our goals. As individuals, and as teams, we need to make sure we're looking at the correct data. If not, we'll be using old our irrelevant data to the task at hand.

### Sorting the Data

If we don't spend time to sort through the new data, it will be almost impossible to retrieve it for later use. As individuals, and as teams, if we're not taking the time to accurately judge the data coming in, we will make bad decisions and will waste time that we probably don't have.

### Storing the Data

Now that we've got the data sorted, we have to store it in the right places. Without good access to our data, we'll retrieve the wrong kind of data, and get something that's too abstract, or too concrete, to help with the task at hand. As individuals, and as teams, if we're not taking the time to understand what kind of information the situation calls for, we won't be effective.

### Retrieving the Data

Retrieving the data is important because without this piece we won't be able to act intelligently, with a fully-informed mindset. We, or our team members, will make decisions in a fog. There will be information useful to us, but we won't be able to access it.

## Don't Skip an Element in Your Pipeline

These things sound trivial, but without attention to each step, you as an individual or your team will get stuck on one of these. I've seen it happen all the time in my career. Someone forgot to look at something, or communicate something, or someone implemented the wrong thing. Many individuals and teams end up making the wrong decisions or stumbling over the same problems. But it's important to analyze why, because the symptoms might be similar, but the root cause might be different, and you or your team may be overlooking the specific root cause.

Attend to your data-processing pipeline. Make sure your team isn't overlooking an element in the pipeline.

### Case Study: Definition and Execution of Goals

Defining one's goals is hard. It's even harder when multiple people are involved, in a team. A lot of activity can happen in a team without moving towards the goal. We might thing we have a goal but sometimes it can be poorly defined or misunderstood by all members of the team. And even if we have good goals, if we can't keep our focus on them as we execute, we can get distracted or lose sight of the goal completely.

For instance, if we're not able to even figure out which goals might even be availabe, we have a problem in the first part of the pipeline. We need to stop what we're doing and figure out what our options are.

If we're able to see multiple possible goals, but unable to figure out the proper criteria to judge them by, we'll have so many options that our actual efforts will not be moving in the same direction. We will get distracted and stay distracted. That comes down to a problem within our sorting capabilities.

If we have a data access or data storage problem, we may have a great goal, but unable to properly bring it up so that we can execute on it. Maybe our team spent a ton of time defining a wonderful goal but no one wrote it down. Or it's not pasted on the wall so we aren't constantly reminded of it.

Finally, we may have a great goal, and everyone knows it, but other things keep us from being able to spend time working on it. Emergencies happen, and our team gets pulled in a different direction. We can't even spend any time on retrieving our goals because we are running in ten other directions.

As we can see, so many things can go wrong in our pipeline. And different people and different people will struggle to get things done, but the reasons can vary. My hope is to nail down exactly what's going wrong in the pipeline so we can move towards our goals together as a team.
