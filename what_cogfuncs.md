1. What are Cognitive Functions?


What cognitive functions are not:

1. for describing behavior.
1. for predicting behavior.
1. for describing mental illness.
1. for predicting mental illness.
1. for deciding who you should date/marry.
1. for deciding which career you should pursue.

I'm not telling you about cognitive functions to change your behavior, I'm not even telling you about cognitive functions to change the way you feel or think. I hope to help you notice when you may need to pay attention in a different way. Or at least notice when you using patterns of attention that won't help you accomplish your goal.

As I've said previously, cognitive functions are categories that describe relationships. Here are the primary relationships:

Two functions for interacting with the world, and navigating oneself within that world: 

1. Between two concrete objects. (Te)
1. Between two people, not including yourself. (Fe)

Two functions for decision-making:

1. Between two abstract objects, not people. (Ti)
1. Between a concrete object or person and yourself. (Fi)

Two functions for attending to the world:

1. Between you and the physical world. (Se)
1. Between you and the abstract world. (Ne)

Two functions for storing and retrieving knowledge:

1. Between you and the library of concrete knowledge. (Si)
1. Between you and the library of abstract knowledge. (Ni)

As you can see, these are very, very, very abstract categories. I don't care about a lot of the stuff you might find in an MBTI description. My goal with this course is to teach the cognitive functions as I understand them, in the most powerful way possible. They get their power from being abstract. I've really tried to boil away any unnecessary part to get to the essence and power of cognitive functions. My understanding of cognitive functions is not so much Jungian as Kantian. Insofar as Jung was a neo-Kantian, we may agree on some things. But I'm not here to teach you Jungian cognitive functions. I'm here to teach you cognitive functions in a way that is abstract enough to apply them to the field of software development. For now, the definitions above may be too abstract, so let me give you some others that will be easier to grasp until I get into more detail when I cover each function individually:


1. Introverted Intuition - abstractions
1. Introverted Sensing - events
1. Extraverted Intuition - connections
1. Extraverted Sensing - facts

1. Introverted Thinking - logic
1. Introverted Feeling - subjectivity 
1. Extraverted Thinking - systems 
1. Extraverted Feeling - collaboration



## Tradeoffs Manifest as Function Axes

There are several kinds of tradeoffs we can encounter. We should be aware about them and notice what we may be giving up when we depend on one function too much, to the detriment of our projects.

1. Ti/Fi - Systematic/Experiential
1. Ti/Fe - Logical/Communal
1. Te/Fi - Practical/Moral
1. Te/Ti - Particular/General
1. Fe/Fi - Individual/Communal
1. Fe/Te - Communal/Practical

There are two other axes that have to do with the data that we deal with:

1. Ni/Si - Abstract knowledge/concrete knowledge
1. Ne/Se - Abstract world/concrete world


### The Dangers in Choosing a Path

There are two primary problems when choosing a path. First, you can choose a path and not be flexible enough to change it. Second, you can bounce around between paths so often you don't actually get anywhere. Cognitive Functions allow you to select a path that isn't too broad, but also not too narrow. And it also gives you a way to figure out if you are missing something as you go along your path.
