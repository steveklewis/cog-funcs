# The Nature of Extraverted Thinking and Extraverted Feeling

If you search online or get on YouTube, you will come across many different definitions for Carl Jung's cognitive functions. Many of these conflict, and very few actually seem to be able to get to the heart of the matter.

My intention in this essay is to more fully ground, philosophically, our definitions of certain cognitive functions, specifically Extraverted Thinking (Te) and Extraverted Feeling (Fe). I hope to do so, not by going back to Carl Jung's definitions, but by going back to those of Immanuel Kant, who was Jung's primary philosophical influence.

## The Predictive Nature of Extraverted Feeling and Extraverted Thinking

According to the definitions of Extraverted Feeling and Extraverted Thinking, they both are categorized as judging functions. When we hear about judging functions around MBTI and other ideas related to cognitive functions, what does that mean? Let's go back to Kant's Second Preface to the Critique of Pure Reason:

> [The scientists] learned that reason only perceives that which it produces after its own design; that it must not be content to follow, as it were, in the leading-strings of nature, but must proceed in advance with principles of judgment according to unvarying laws, and compel nature to reply its questions.

A judgement is a question, first of all, and a guess, a hypothesis about that question. According to Kant, we do not derive laws just be examining our perceptions. Rather, we verify and understand our perceptions only after proposing the laws that might be involved in our perceptions. Kant continues to clarify what he means:

> Reason must approach nature with the view, indeed, of receiving information from it, not, however, in the character of a pupil, who listens to all that his master chooses to tell him, but in that of a judge, who compels the witnesses to reply to those questions which he himself thinks fit to propose.

Now we see more clearly the active nature of judgement, and how it's not so much a question or a hypothesis, but an attitude towards the world that attempts to predict the future, to predict what will happen.

With this help from Kant, we can attempt a definition of a judgement: A judgement is a prediction of behavior. That prediction of behavior can apply to either the physical world or to human behavior.

So a judging function, like Extraverted Feeling or Extraverted Thinking takes in a perception, and generates a prediction about the world, that can then be verified. That is what makes Fe and Te judging functions: the fact that they are predictive.

## The Synthetical Nature of Extraverted Thinking and Extraverted Thinking

Even at the beginning of his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant is talking about what reason starts with as it thinks about the world:

> [Reason] begins with principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field of experience, and the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the same time, insured by experience.

This combination of principles and experience, Kant will refer to as synthetical. These kinds of predictive operations of the mind make up what are known as the Extraverted Judging Functions. For Kant, a synthetical process is one that combines principles and experiences to create a prediction about the future. The combination is what makes the Extraverted Judging functions so powerful, when applied in the world. They combine the rigor of principles and the raw reality of our past and present experiences to make predictions about the future. The Cognitive Functions that Kant calls synthetical, Jung will call Extraverted and Rational, but what most nowadays, given the influence of MBTI, know as the Extraverted Judging functions.


## Predictive and Synthetical Functions: How the Syntax Works

As I have tried to explain that [Cognitive Functions are functional](cog_funcs_are_functional.md), Judging Functions accept one or more perceptions and return another perception, where that returned perception is our prediction:

    Our prediction = Fe(Si, Ni, Se)

    where

    Si = our experiences,

    Ni = the rules we've derived from our experiences, and

    Se = raw data from the physical world

What makes these Judging Functions synthetical is that we are using the rules derived from our lived experiences and the data from the external world, and combining them to form our prediction about the world.
