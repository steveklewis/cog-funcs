# Extraverted Perception - Extraverted Intuition and Extraverted Sensing

We have a relationship with the world. But not all relationships are the same. We have a relationship with the physical world, and with the metaphysical world, and it's our job to put them together. I like to think of them as two different theaters. There is a physical theater, and a metaphysical theater. And we observe what is on the stage and we can act on each stage.

We have a tendency to prefer one stage over the other, which in turn gives us a bit of lopsidedness, and that lopsidedness leads us to our strengths, and our weaknesses. In order to accomplish a goal, we need to be able to ideate in the abstract world and act in the physical world. We have to adapt to pay attention to the proper horizon at the proper time.

## Extraverted Perception Allows Us to Create

As we attend to whichever world we prefer, that sustained attention allows us to notice and monitor and oversee ourselves as we express our creativity. Whether in the physical world or the metaphysical world, we couldn't act without a theater and without a stage to act upon.

A software program requires mostly attention to the metaphysical, abstract world. But it can't become a working program without some attention to the look and feel and actual functionality of the artifacts programmers create.

Similarly, if we make a chair, we're paying most of our attention to the physical world. But we're comparing the physical world to a pattern of a chair that resides in our minds. You can't make a chair without both kinds of extraverted perception.

## Case Study: Is Being Well-Spoken Categorized As Extraverted Intuition or Extraverted Sensing?

Some might say that speaking or talking is a good moniker for Extraverted Intuition, while some might argue that speaking should be categorized in Extraverted Sensing. I would like to argue that speaking requires both Extraverted Intuition and Extraverted Sensing. Speaking requires both formulating a thought and verbalizing that thought. It's like serving food at a restaurant. You can't make food without a kitchen. Similarly, you can't serve food without a dining room.

To bring it back to our example of a stage, thoughts that appear on the metaphysical stage may or may not manifest on the physical stage. And actions that are performed on the physical stage may or may not be informed by abstract creations that appear on the metaphysical horizon. It's up to us to gain the skills necessary to be adept on both stages so that we can be creative.
