# Hegel's Logic



## Hegel's Only Got Two Moves

From what I've gathered, Hegel only uses two moves in the Logic. Hegel's first move is negation. Negation is the simplest logical operation. It takes a single something, and returns the opposite of that something. Hegel's second move is that of observation. It's not really a logical operation, per se, but observing how two categories interact inevitably implies a third category. Using these two moves, Hegel develops the purest, most basic definition of Being into his full logical system.

## From Being to Becoming

Hegel starts with his most definition of Being: "indeterminate immediacy." Hegel attempts to start with the most basic of concepts, and make the smallest logical move possible to build up more complicated ideas.

That smallest possible logical move possible requires us to use negation. The negation of Being, is Nothing. What's the opposite of being other than nothing? It seems almost obvious.

The first move was that of negation. Now that we have two ideas, Being and Nothing, we need to do something else, and that something else is observing. We need to observe the logical relationship between Being and Nothing. Hegel has already defined Being as indeterminate immediacy. And yet Nothing, even though it is the negation of Being, also has this same structural definition, or lack thereof. The Nothing is also indeterminate immediacy.

Because Being and Nothing have identical structures, even though we know they are different ideas, logically they bleed into one another. Our mind's eye tries to hold onto Being, but it is led to Nothing. If we try to focus on Nothing, we are led to ponder Being. Logically, it creates a shimmering, as Stephen Houlgate says, or a flickering. By observing Being and Nothing, we have observed an instability in its relationship, and that instability leads us to another concept: Becoming. Becoming is that shimmering, that flickering, that unsettled, ever-changing flux.
