# Hegel's Logic



## Hegel's Only Got Two Moves

From what I've gathered, Hegel only uses two moves in the Logic. Hegel's first move is negation. Negation is the simplest logical operation. It takes a single something, and returns the opposite of that something. Hegel's second move is that of observation. It's not really a logical operation, per se, but observing how two categories interact inevitably implies a third category. Using these two moves, Hegel develops the purest, most basic definition of Being into his full logical system.

## From Being to Becoming

Hegel starts with his most definition of Being: "indeterminate immediacy." Hegel attempts to start with the most basic of concepts, and make the smallest logical move possible to build up more complicated ideas.
