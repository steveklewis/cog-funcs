# Hegel's Logic: Two Moves from Being to Becoming

Recently, I finished reading Stephen Houlgate's _The Opening of Hegel's Logic_. I had decided to read it after reading Immanuel Kant's _Critique of Pure Reason_ two years ago and Soren Kierkegaard's _Concluding Unscientific Postscript_. Hegel is the major philosopher sandwhiched in time between the towering genius of Kant and the incisive critique of Kierkegaard. Primarily, Kierkegaard's criticism of systems is aimed at Hegel.

However, the primary reason I decided to learn about Hegel was his project around categories in the Logic. For Kant, categories are extremely important to his own project, but Kant assumes them, and does not try to prove or derive or substantiate the categories themselves. Hegel attempts to do just that.

And so, after reading Houlgate's book on the Logic, my understanding of Hegel's project in the Logic is to derive categories that we use, starting with the least-defined, moving towards the most-defined. I would like to run through the two basic logical operations that Hegel uses to derive each category. Once he has established his preliminary definition of Being, he only uses these two logical operations.

## Hegel's Logical Chess

From what I've gathered, after reading Stephen Houlgate's book, is that Hegel only uses two moves in the Logic. It's like Hegel has challenged himself to a game of Logical Chess and it has a weird chessboard and there are only two pieces. Hegel's first piece is that of the Negater. When it moves to an opponent's piece it negates that piece. If it were chess, it would turn a pawn into a king, or a rook into a bishop. Hegel's second Logical Chess piece is the Observer. It takes two pieces and observes the connection between the two, creating a third.

## The Starting Point: Being

Why does Hegel start with Being? Well, he needs a starting point for his project. He is attempting to avoid all assumptions and presuppositions in constructing his philosophy. For Hegel, the thought of Being is that minimal starting point. What is the thought that assumes the least about reality and about itself. It is the simple thought of Being. There's no structure, no definition, no color, no shape, nothing that our mind can hold onto as a concrete reality. But we think. We have to think. But we can attempt to start with the smallest possible idea we can find, and for Hegel, like many other philosophers before him, thought begins with the thought of Being.

## The First Move: From Being to Nothing

Hegel starts with his definition of Being: "indeterminate immediacy." Hegel attempts to start with the most basic of concepts, and make the smallest logical move possible to build up more complicated ideas. That smallest logical move possible is that of negation. Negation is the simplest logical operation. It takes a single something, and returns the opposite of that something. It's the simplest because all other logical operations require more than one something. For instance, in mathematics, the addition operation requires two operands. In constrast, negation only requires a single operand.

Therefore, since we have a single operand that Hegel has given us (Being), and we have an operation that only requires one operand (negation), we can execute the first move in Hegel's logic. The negation of Being, is Nothing. What's the opposite of being other than nothing? It seems almost obvious.

## The Origin of Hegel's First Move

Hegel got his first move from Rene Descartes. When discussing the relationship between the infinite and the finite, he poses, that perhaps the idea that we don't have a true, direct understanding of the infinite, but only perceive "... the infinite ...  merely by negating the finite ...." That idea of negation, of moving from one idea to another, is where Hegel got the idea of his first move.

## The Necessity of a Second Move

Now, Hegel could not play his game of Logical Chess for long if he only had one move. He could negate, and thereby take one step forward. But if he negates what he just negated, he will have made one step forward and one step backward. He will arrive back where he came. In order to continue his project, Hegel needs way to move beyond negation. That second operation is observation.

## The Second Move: From Being and Nothing to Becoming

The first move was that of negation. Now that we have two ideas, Being and Nothing, we need to do something else, and that second move is observing. We need to observe the logical relationship between Being and Nothing. Hegel has already defined Being as indeterminate immediacy. And yet Nothing, even though it is the negation of Being, also has this same structural definition, or lack thereof. The Nothing is also indeterminate immediacy.

Because Being and Nothing have identical structures, even though we know they are different ideas, logically they bleed into one another, because they are equally indeterminate and equally immediate. Our mind's eye tries to hold onto Being, but it is led to Nothing. If we try to focus on Nothing, we are led to ponder Being. Logically, it creates a shimmering effect, as Stephen Houlgate says, or a flickering. By observing Being and Nothing, we have observed a flickering instability in its relationship, and that instability leads us to another concept: Becoming. Becoming is that shimmering, that flickering, that unsettled, ever-changing flux.

## The Meaning of the Second Move

To speak of Becoming we must discuss Heraclitus.

Hegel's project is an attempt to get beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%27s_antinomies">Kant's antinomies</a>, where we are stuck in logical contradictions with no way to decide which one is true. According to Kant, reason alone can not help us navigate our way out of the logical contradictions we come across. Hegel is trying to find a way out of this logical impasse, and so his second move, that of observation, tries to perceive the logical movement implied in the relationship between two categories. Each concept, each category, has a structure, and the relationships between those two structures moves thought naturally to another category. It is like following the natural line of the sealine as we stand on the shore. Our eye wants to follow the shoreline to the horizon. Similarly, when we consider two or more categories, our mind automatically tries to follow the shape of those categories to see what is different, or what is common, or our intuition presents us with a third category, somehow connected to the others.



## The Meaning of Hegel's Two Moves

Hegel is attempting to painstakingly create a system of concepts that naturally lead to each other, by exercising the minimum logical effort to move between the concepts in that system. He is trying, unlike Kant, to not assume certain categories are automatically assumed, and to see where the mind slowly leads as it ponders the concepts before it. In my opinion, it is a fascinating thought experiment, and one that can help us understand how categories work and how to move between them.
