# Heraclitus and Complexity

> You could not step twice into the same river. Heraclitus

## Heraclitus' Idea of Flux 

There are at least two major interpretations of what this saying means. The first, from Plato, emphasizes the ever-changing nature of reality, sometimes called "flux," in contradistinction to Parmenides' monism that attempts to see the unchanging nature of reality. However, there is another interpretation that seems to balance both the stability of reality and the ever-present change that still occurs:

> If this interpretation is right, the message of the one river fragment, B12, is not that all things are changing so that we cannot encounter them twice, but something much more subtle and profound. It is that some things stay the same only by changing. One kind of long-lasting material reality exists by virtue of constant turnover in its constituent matter. Here constancy and change are not opposed but inextricably connected. [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus](Heraclitus @ Stanford)

I would like to put forth a third interpretation that is perhaps a bit more abstract. To me, what is interesting about Heraclitus is that what he's describing is nature itself, or the natural world. But it doesn't have to be the natural world. It could be any world that contains enough complexity that requires us to dive in and get familiar with it in order to begin to understand it. Any world, whether it is the physical world, or the world of geology, or mathematics, or anything else, is sufficiently complex and ever changing such that we have to dive in, in order to gain any knowledge about it, and even then it's an ever-changing landscape.

## Heraclitus and the Many

Heraclitus is sometimes personified as representing the idea of "the many" as opposed to Parmenides as a representative of "the one" or monism. "The many" could alternatively be described as complexity itself, and one can take his statement that one cannot step twice into the same river as a definition of complexity.

## Heraclitus and Immanuel Kant's Manifold

Immanuel Kant seems to pick up on an aspect of this when he uses the term "manifold" to describe any sufficiently complicated sphere of knowledge. In our mind, we haven't sorted everything out, but we know it's complex and many-sided, and will take some work to understand.

## Heraclitus and Time as an Essential Aspect of a World

An essential aspect of nature, or any world, the many, or a manifold, is that it unfolds in time. It takes time to look around and get familiar with our surroundings when we step into a new world.

And that is why I find Heraclitus interesting, because he offers us a definition of a world. A world is complex.
