# Heraclitus and Complexity

> You could not step twice into the same river. Heraclitus

## Heraclitus' Idea of Flux 

When you read most commentaries on Heraclitus' fragment about the river, you usually see this categorized as Heraclitus' doctrine of flux. While that is true, in that it emphasizes the mutability of reality, I don't think it gets entirely to the heart of the matter. To me, this is interesting because what Heraclitus is describing is nature itself, or the natural world. But it doesn't have to be the natural world. It could be any world that contains enough complexity that requires us to dive in and get familiar with it in order to begin to understand it. Any world, whether it is the physical world, or the world of geology, or mathematics, or anything else, is sufficiently complex and ever changing such that we have to dive in, in order to gain any knowledge about it, and even then it's an ever-changing landscape.

## Heraclitus and the Many

Heraclitus is sometimes personified as representing the idea of "the many" as opposed to Parmenides as a representative of "the one" or oneness. "The many" could alternatively be described as complexity itself, and one can take his statement that one cannot step twice into the same river as a definition of complexity.

## Heraclitus and Immanuel Kant's Manifold

Immanuel Kant seems to pick up on an aspect of this when he uses the term "manifold" to describe any sufficiently complicated sphere of knowledge. In our mind, we haven't sorted everything out, but we know it's complex and many-sided, and will take some work to understand.

## Heraclitus and Time as an Essential Aspect of a World

An essential aspect of nature, or any world, the many, or a manifold, is that it unfolds in time. It takes time to look around and get familiar with our surroundings when we step into a new world.

And that is why I find Heraclitus interesting, because he offers us a definition of a world.
