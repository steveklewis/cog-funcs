Dante's Third Guide: Bernard's Theory and Experience of Loving God

Dante, as the pilgrim in the Divine Comedy, in his journey toward seeing God at the end of the Paradiso, finds himself guided by three historical figure. First, Virgil leads him through hell to the top of Purgatory. Beatrice appears as his second guide and explains things as they move through Paradiso. Near the end of Paradiso, Beatrice vanishes and St. Bernard of Clairvaux spends only a few cantos with Dante before the end of the poem.
  Yet why does Dante choose Bernard? We have a pretty good idea by the time we finish reading why Dante chose Virgil and Beatrice to show up as characters in his story. But very little indicates why he would have chosen Bernard. I think there are a couple of reasons why Dante chooses him to lead Dante: first, he tells on St. Mary as the one who sends St. Lucia in the beginning of the Inferno. Secondly, he stands as an exemplar of one who exhibits devoted love to the Mother of God, and therefore Dante lets him pray to the Mother of God in the final canto. However, I want to examine the philosophical reasons he is there. 

** God And Self

If we examine the beginning and the end of the Divine Comedy, a start contrast emerges. At the end, Dante sees God. But at the beginning, Dante can only see himself and the dangers that surround him. Two objects, worthy of our attention: God and self, self and God. One could go as far as to say that Dante, as we come to the beginning of the Divine Comedy, without a guide, has been misguided, and has gotten lost in the dark wood. He is lost in all the possibilities of how to be, and doesn't even see the love of God as a proper object. In contradistinction, by the end of the Divine Comedy, he has found multiple guides and has learned to love God. So what is the thing that changes, between the first canto, and the last canto? It would appear that the object of Dante's love has moved from self, towards God. And that would be correct. But I believe there is more going on here.

** Objects of Love and Reasons for Love

  Bernard, in _On Loving God_, juxtaposes self and God. But he does it in such a way as to introduce nuance and a progression from self to God. First, there are self and God as objects. The object of our love can be self, or it can be God. Yet love is not so simple. We can love the right things for the wrong reasons. And we can love the wrong things for the right reasons. So he presents us with two reasons as well: the reason of self, of selfishness, and the reason of God, of the right reason. This allows Bernard to present us with four degrees of loving, as we can combine the objects and reasons of love in four different ways:

1. Loving self for the sake of oneself.
2. Loving God for the sake of oneself.
3. Loving God for God's sake.
4. Loving self for God's sake.

When I first read this schema it struck me intuitively true, both theoretically and experientially. I found it so simple, yet original and powerful. Emero Steigman explains the four degrees as our struggle with God:

> Bernard's intuitions regard a simplicity characterizing the human situation, which he represents, not as good against evil, but as the struggle between self and God, somewhat in the manner of Jacob wrestling with the angel. He configures four degrees in the victory of divine love, with the love of self first and last, and the love of God at the pivotal center-- God on either side, now as sustainer and now as lover. This chiasmic configuration preserves for Saint Bernard both the simplicity of the confrontation, as grand design, and the complexity of it in our experience. Emero Steigman, On Loving God, An Analytical Commentary.

I truly feel like Dante was trying to tell us something in choosing Bernard as his third guide, and I will argue that there are three major transformations in the Divine Comedy, and they correspond with the three guides that lead Dante to the eventual vision of God:

1. Loving self for the sake of oneself. (Dante at the beginning of Canto 1 of the Inferno)
2. Loving God for the sake of oneself. (Dante at the end of Canto 1 of the Inferno)
3. Loving self for God's sake. (Dante at the top of Mount Purgatory)
4. Loving God for God's sake. (Dante in the final canto of the Paradiso)

For the purposes of this essay, I want to cover Virgil and Beatrice as guides, but primarily I want to focus on Bernard as a rational lover of God. He loves God for the right reasons.

** The First Transformation

In the first stage, Dante loves self for the sake of himself. This love isn't inherently evil, but it is misguided, and without a guide, leads Dante into the dark wood, where we find him in the first canto. We know that his journey will end at stage four, Loving God for God's sake. Bernard describes Dante's predicament at the beginning of the Divine Comedy: "The wicked, therefore, walk around in circles, naturally wanting whatever will satisfy their desires, yet foolishly rejecting that which would lead them to their true end, which is not in consumption but in consummation." p. 22. What is Bernard's solution, his answer? Near the beginning of the letter, Bernard lays it out as simply as he can: "My answer is that God himself is the reason to be loved." 

One can imagine the lost Dante hearing that advice at the beginning of his journey and being puzzled Bernard's simple solution. Luckily, Bernard knows that answer is meant for those who have already gotten towards the end of their journey. His answer is technically correct but makes no sense yet because the inexperienced wayfarer has barely begun the journey.

In the second stage, Dante begins to turn toward God, in loving God for the sake of oneself. In this stage, one loves God for the benefits one receives. In the first canto we can already see Dante's need for help, and the help he receives in the form of Virgil. Dante and Virgil travel all the way through hell, and Dante gets to experience how God keeps him safe on his journey, harrowing as it is. We even see Dante begin to increase in his love for God after Dante and Virgil exit the Inferno and stand on the shores of Mount Purgatory. There's a wonderful scene near the beginning of the Purgatorio where Virgil and Dante spend some time recovering from their ordeal going through hell. They get washed up, and ready to go, and they stand on the shoreline and look up at the mountain they are about to begin climbing, and Dante gives us this image:

> We still were on the border of the sea,
> Like people who are thinking of their road,
> Who go in heart and with the body stay. (Purgatorio, Canto 2, Longfellow)

After reading those lines, I have to conclude Dante almost certainly read _On Loving God_. Bernard explains spiritually, what goes on at the beach:

> If they could only be content with reaching all in thought and not in deed. They could easily do so and it would not be in vain, for man's mind is more comprehensive and subtle than his senses. It even anticipates the senses in all things and they dare not contact an object unless the mind approves the utility beforehand ... The mind looks ahead for the senses and these must not pursue their desires unless the mind gives its consent. Otherwise, you do not ascend the Lord's mountain or stand in his holy place, because you have received your soul in vain, that is, your rational soul; while you follow your senses like a dumb beast, you sleepy reason offers no resistance.

Dante's beastly desires have been quelled, and his mind is free to wander ahead. While his bodily desires aren't raging, his mind still wanders. He is still searching for satisfaction, which he won't finally realize until the vision of God at the end of Paradiso.

** The Second Transformation

In the third stage, Dante is declared to have self-mastery: his will has been purified. He does not have perfect knowledge of God, but he no longer loves other things more than God. This is represented by Bernard's third stage, loving self for God's sake. We see Virgil declare Dante master of himself:

> Expect no more or word or sign from me;
> Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,
> And error were it not to do its bidding;
> Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre! (Purgatorio, Canto 27, Longfellow)

God now loves God for God's sake. All of his self-directed love has been redirected towards God, and he is free to enter Paradiso with Beatrice.

** The Third Transformation

Before we get to the argument, let's summarize what Bernard does in Dante's narrative. By the time Bernard arrives, Dante and Beatrice have already made it to the hightest sphere, the Empyrean. Dante turns to Beatrice but she is gone, and in her place stands Bernard. He says:

> To lead you through the goal of all your wish
> Beatrice called me from my place.

Bernard then points out where Beatrice has gone, showing Dante her seat in the stadium. Dante prays to Beatrice. Then Bernard says:

> I have been sent
> by prayer and sacred love to help you reach
> the perfect consummation of your ascent.

> Look round this garden, therefore, that you may
> by gazing at its radiance, be prepared
> to lift your eyes up to the Trinal Ray.

> The Queen of Heaven, for whom in whole devotion
> I burn with love, will grant us every grace,
> because I am Bernard, her faithful one.

Bernard then instructs Dante to look upwards towards Mary, the Queen of Heaven. Bernard then also looks at Mary. Bernard explans who is sitting nearby Mary, and then asks Dante to join him as he prays to the Mother of God. Bernard prays his prayer and Dante is allowed to see God.
  As we can see from the narrative, Bernard's primary function is to pray to the Mother of God at the end, so that Dante can see God. This seems to imply that something hapens to Dante to further purify his vision or his heart, so that he can see God. One can recall Jesus saying in the Beatitudes, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." I would like to suggest that Dante gains a more pure love for God at the end of the Paradiso, and that Bernard's four degrees found in _On Loving God_ can illuminate the change that occurs within Dante. On my reading, Dante finally loves God for God's sake, that is, he loves God for the right reasons, for God as a person, and not for what God can reward. This final transformation corresponds with Bernard's final degree of love in _On Loving God_, that of loving God for God's sake. We will revisit this point after the four degrees of love are discussed in more detail. While I have started from the end of the Paradiso, we will have to return to the beginning now.











"It is important to point out which generation finds consolation in remembering God." p. 12.

"God is not to be loved without a reward, although he should be loved without regard for one." p. 20.

"Love pertains to the will, it is not a transaction; it cannot acquire or be acquired by a pact. Moving freely, it makes us spontaneous."
