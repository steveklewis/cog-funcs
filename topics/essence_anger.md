# The Essence of Anger

What is anger? What does it do? What is it for? If it evolved over millions of years of evolution, does it retain the same purpose it did, when we find ourselves in a modern society? I learned, on my journey, that I didn't have the healthiest relationship with anger, and one of the most important pieces of the puzzle was reading Karla McLaren's [The Language of Emotions](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Emotions-What-Feelings-Trying/dp/1591797691).

Karla McLaren personifies the activities of anger, telling us that anger is about boundaries. "Anger sets your boundaries by walking the perimeter of your soul and keeping an eye on you, the people around you, and your environment." While anger is about boundaries, I have come to view the essence of anger as a response consisting of a simple, "No." Without being able to say "no," I don't have any boundaries.

There are a lot of bad ideas and advice floating around about anger. But anger isn't evil. It's an essential part of the human experience, and anger is an essential part of you. You never want to be a person that is totally incapable of being angry. We are not robots, and we are not meant to walk through life as ghosts, either. Karla McLaren's book was very helpful in revamping my perception of anger. She also has suggestions for healthy practices around anger.

## Anger and the Enneagram Nine

Another piece of the puzzle around anger was learning I'm an Enneagram Nine. One of the curious things about the [Enneagram Nine](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9) is that unhealthy Nines don't know how to say "no." That inability to say "no" stems from the unhealthy Enneagram Nines' peculiar relationship with anger. While they are motivated by anger, they are primarily motivated by the avoidance of feeling anger. Anger feels bad, may lead to conflict, and somebody might get hurt, so better to avoid it altogether. But that's unhealthy, and ends up making things worse in the long run.

Enneagram Nines lose a fundamental engine of motivation if they avoid anger. It means someone has to shame you or make you afraid to get you to do something. You can't tap into the natural resource of anger to get things done that you don't really want to do. But sometimes life requires you to do those things, and plugging into that source of angry energy allows you to do them without devaluing yourself and without always living scared. Unhealthy Enneagram Nines avoid anger, and thereby they end up avoiding life. You can't say "yes" to everything and be who you need to be in this world for the people you love.

## Anger and Clarity

Without anger your thinking tends to be fuzzy, as well. If you have no boundaries for yourself, it's also difficult to maneuver boundaries in and around ideas. Things seem to look similar, if you squint hard enough. Tapping into a healthy anger brings clarity to yourself, your ideas, and to social situations because you know where you begin and where you end. You know where you stand in relation to something or someone else. You can't get clarity without anger.
