* The Philosopher Anaximander is Interesting 

I want to tell you about one of my favorite pieces of philosophy. The oldest official piece of Western philosophy is known as the Anaximander fragment. It is 2500 years old. It is the first actual attempt at philosophical abstraction:

> Whence things have their origin, there they must also pass away according to necessity; for they must pay penalty and be judged for their injustice, according to the ordinance of time.

There are so many implications in this short snippet of philosophy. It attempts to explain how things come to be and how they lose their existence. There is still a bit of the poetic language, and the goddess Dike (justice) makes an appearance, but it is saying something very interesting about the structure of the world. What is so fascinating to me is how much it says in so few words. It applies to anything that comes in to existence. It makes an assertion about where things go when they lose their existence. It uses some strange legal terminology about penalties and injustice, and aims to explain the most fundamental of processes in legal terms. Finally, that thing which judges and penalizes is time.

I don't have much more to say about it. I just wanted to share the wonder I had at that first, oldest piece of Western philosophy, when I first heard it over twenty-five years ago.
