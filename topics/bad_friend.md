# Self-Awareness - How to be a Bad Friend

### Connectedness

One of the things I've learned about myself, with the help of various personality systems, is that I'm a bad friend. One of my strengths in StrengthsFinder 2.0 is [Connectedness](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gallup-strengthsfinder-managing-connectedness-theme-susan-surtel). I believe in the connectedness of everything. Which, in general, I believe is good, but it can have some negative effects if you're not careful. In the Enneagram system, connectedness would be most easily associated with the Nine, the Peacemaker.

### Enneagram Nine - the Peacemaker

[The Nine](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9) believes that everything is connected and can see a situation from multiple perspectives. However, there's a danger that the Peacemaker perceives a false peace. That's what I had done with my friendships over the years. I've made many connections with people over the years, and just because I feel a connection with them doesn't mean that we are actually close. There are people from school and college and various organizations that I haven't kept in touch with, but I hope that they would think as fondly of me as I think of them. But I didn't keep the friendship going, I moved away, I got busy, I got self-absorbed, because that's just how I am.

### Ignoring Extraverted Feeling

Another thing that exarcerbates this tendency is the fact that I am an INFP. An MBTI INFP is roughly the same as a Socionics INFj, and Socionics says something interesting about the INFP's relationship with Extraverted Feeling, which is the cognitive function that pays attention to friends. Socionics calls it my [Ignoring Function](https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/functions/Id). Which means I'm so focused on Introverted Feeling that I ignore and spend almost no time on Extraverted Feeling.

Which is true. I haven't kept up with the friends I've made. I've let them fall away, and my belief in connectedness led me to think that that was okay. That they would be there when I really needed them, simply because I remembered them fondly. And I've underestimated my need for friendship because I do enjoy being alone, in my thoughts, by myself. INFPs have a rich inner world that no one knows about, unless they happen to be a fiction writer.

Now, there may be valid reasons for finding oneself in this predicament. Lack of emotional boundaries, idealization and then demonization of other people, black-and-white thinking, which I've had, in spades. But it still doesn't make you a good friend just because you have extenuating circumstances or bad habits.

## Being Half of a Good Friend

As one can see, there are a few reasons why my personality type might end up being a bad friend. But the news isn't all bad. People with my personality type can be great listeners, and can be very accepting of people who are different. The world is full of people who have the ability to be great friends and shun those not like them. But there needs to be some balance, so that a person can figure out the appropriate times to attend to oneself and the appropriate times to tend to others.
