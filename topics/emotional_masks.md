# The Emotional Masks

For an unhealthy Enneagram Nine, apathy, boredom, and confusion are constant companions. At their unhealthiest, both healthy anger and healthy fear can't get through the fog of these other feelings of apathy, boredom, and confusion that mask deeper emotions. The signal is garbled and we can't get any useful information out of our most helpful emotions. But even these masks tell us something: that we're angry or afraid and aren't ready to face reality.  They act as shields, to protect us from the full, raw force of the underlying emotions, emotions that we're not ready to face or emotions we're incapable of facing.

By staying in the safer emotions of apathy and confusion, the Enneagram Nine can keep her or his perspective of reality that everything is fine, everything is okay. And that's how I was, at work and at home, before I understood I was an Enneagram Nine.

## Apathy and Boredom, the Mask of Anger

I realized, years later, that I was just bored. I'd been working at the same place for over ten years, and I needed a change. There was lots of stuff going on, and I accomplished some things I'm truly proud to be a parf of, but I didn't really feel like I was moving forward. With struggles at work and at home, I had become apathetic. I felt trapped, and didn't even understand how to take the first step outside of that. I was angry, at myself, at my situation, at others, but I had no healthy access to that angry energy. I should have left that job years ago. But it was comfortable and safe, and it was the first job I had where I felt like I knew what I was doing.


Karla Mclaren describes the connection between apathy and boredom, and anger:

> The "masking" state of apathy (or boredom) arises when you're unable or unwilling to deal with your true anger. (191)

I couldn't deal with my anger around being bored at work, and so boredom allowed me to stay in that job, even though that boredom would eventually hurt my ability to perform at work. Karla McLaren further explains how the environment can play a part in our apathy:

> Apathy is a dissociated state, usually related to being stuck in the wrong environment for your needs. Because it masks emotion, though, apathy is powerless; it longs for change, but it doesn't have the emotional agility to make conscious change happen. (191)

That was me. I was stuck. Unable to find a better environment, but also unable to improve myself within my current environment.

> Apathy points to a loss of boundaries, and to a distinct and urgent need for change, but it does so in an ineffectual and distractible way. (192-3)

> Boredom is a sign of becoming a product or a victim of your environment, instead of an active and aware participant. (193)




## Confusion, the Mask of Fear

So I stayed too long, got bored. Inevitably, I got a bad review at work. But I didn't understand. It was a shock and a surprise. Maybe I should have expected it. But I didn't. I was confused. I didn't even know who I could trust. I thought I knew what was what at work. And suddenly I didn't. I realize now I should have left. But I had spread myself too thin, I was burned out, I didn't have a solid specialty as a generalist, and I had no idea what it meant to have a strength. I had a right to be afraid, but I didn't know how to process that fear so I stayed, confused, at the job for another two years.

One of the major gifts of fear is it bring you in touch with your intention. Fear sees clearly, and 

Confusion is essentially a form of dissociation that takes you out of commission when you've lost your way. It's a bit like apathy, which is also a masking state, but instead of being bored or lusting after shiny things, you can't decide what you want. (258)

Our confusion lifts, our real feelings come forward, our focus and grounding come back, and we become able to think coherently and stand upright again. (258)
