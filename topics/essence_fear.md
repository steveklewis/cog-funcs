# The Essence of Fear

What is fear? What is it for? What is its purpose? What does it do for us? Unlike my [experience with anger](essence_anger.md], fear was something I knew much more intimately. It was my primary motivational emotion. But, similarly to my understanding of anger, I had never really considered those questions revolving around its true nature.

As with anger, my first consideration of fear began with Karla McLaren's [The Language of Emotions](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Emotions-What-Feelings-Trying/dp/1591797691). She describes what fear does for us: "Fear hones your senses, alerts your innate survival skills, and increases your ability to respond effectively to novel or changing environments." One of the interesting things she says about fear is that it is both intuitional and action-oriented. It combines perception and judgement at the same time, so you can act in the moment. "When your fear flows freely, you become competent, capable, and intelligent in every area of your life." Without a proper relationship to fear, we don't have access to the information we need in any given moment. "Fear stops you--not to immobilize you, but to give you the time you need to gather yourself and your resources." Fear rises within us whenever we receive new information. "Remember that fear becomes activated when you encounter change." And it gives us the focus to move through the changing landscape, intelligently. "When you can channel your fear properly, it will contribute a sense of self-preservation while it pushes you to study, prepare, and renew your understanding of courage as the capacity to live life on your own terms, rather than throw yourself headlong into fearless or daredevilish behaviors." 

## Fear as a Generalized Capacity 

The interesting move here is that it's a redefinition of fear into a more general capability. The information within fear is available in all kinds of situations, and it comes with varying degrees of intensity.  We're not using fear only when we are terrified of being eaten by zombies. It's a power within us that is always on and always available. Even when it's just a quiet sense within us. This generalization of fear allows one to really pay attention when you're actually using fear, and it puts normal use of fear into perspective, so you're not as afraid of fear. And this energy of fear allows us to be creative.

## What Can Fear Create?

Okay. Now I want to layer another set of categories onto this view of fear as a more generalized thing. If fear can be applied and deployed in different situations, what are the primary categories in which fear can manifest as something creative? 
One of the most effective tools I've discovered in my wanderings the past few years has been the Enneagram. It's especially helpful around the motivation of fear. Three of the numbers within the Enneagram are primarily motivated by fear. Types [five](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5), [six](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-6), and [seven](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7) are each motivated by fear, but have different expressions of that motivation. When we're motivated by fear, we have three options in converting that fear into something creative. We can create knowledge, actions, or words.

## Creating Knowledge

For most of us, fear is to be avoided. But we all have different strategies and habits for avoiding fear. For the Enneagram Type Five, that strategy is to learn as much as one can about various topics so that one can be safe. To be safe, one has to see where the dangers lie, and construct a library of knowledge on how to avoid danger, and a set of tactics to get out of danger if one gets into a sticky situation.

## Acting Creatively

The Enneagram Type Six, rather than creating knowledge, uses fear to avoid decisions that could lead to danger. From a certain perspective, a kind of conservatism could creep in, but the Type Six, as they become so accustomed to living with fear, are able to actually discern which choices actually lead to danger, and act freely because they are prepared for the worst. Karla McLaren identifies the primary question that fear asks as, "What action should be taken?" Type Sixes are all about intuitive action.

## Speaking Creatively

The Enneagram Type Seven loves to avoid fear. They will go on endless adventures or talk incessantly to avoid focusing on the fear. But if they can stand a little fear they can become extremely good at finding the right words. This attention to the verbal world allows Sevens to be gregarious and fun-loving, always looking for the new thing to distract them.

## The Information Within Fear

As you can see, there are both positives and negatives to being able to create using the energy within fear. Fear is risky. But the goal is to have a healthy understanding and expression of fear so we can be more creative in a healthy way. Fear is a motivational energy that comes in many intensities and can be deployed in many situations to help you focus and pay attention to what you need to attend to. At its essence, fear is attention.
