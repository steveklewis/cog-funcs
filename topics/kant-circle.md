* Kant and the Circle: Reason as Higher Power

We find, in Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a description of those who are unable to find truth, and try anything and everything to satisfy their search:

> The wicked, therefore, walk around in circles, naturally wanting whatever will satisfy their desires, yet foolishly rejecting that which would lead them to their true end, which is not in consumption but in consummation. (Bernard, p. 22)

Dante would go on to pick up this image of the circular, hellish existence in his _Inferno_. We can find Bernard explaining how those who love God find the non-circular, direct route to truth:

> The desire to experience all things first is like a vicious circle, it goes on forever. The just man is not like that. Hearing about the evil conduct of those inside the circle (for many follow the wide road which leads to death), he prefers the royal road which turns neither to the right nor to the left. (Bernard, p. 23)

While Bernard begins his discussion of this circular search in terms of immoral deeds, he continues to describe a similar search that occurs within the mind:

> If they could only be content with reaching all in thought and not in deed. They could easily do so and it would not be in vain, for man's mind is more comprehensive and subtle than his senses. It even anticipates the senses in all things and they dare not contact an object unless the mind approves the utility beforehand ... The mind looks ahead for the senses and these must not pursue their desires unless the mind gives its consent. Otherwise, you do not ascend the Lord's mountain or stand in his holy place, because you have received your soul in vain, that is, your rational soul; while you follow your senses like a dumb beast, you sleepy reason offers no resistance.

Bernard implies that the mind can search, and find truth, if the body can be tamed for a time.

While not mentioning Bernard or Dante, Kant picks up on a similar hopeless and circular philosophical journey, and attempts to place the philosopical search on a more direct route.

> When we call into play a faculty of cognition, different conceptions manifest themselves according to the different circumstances, and make known this faculty, and assemble themselves into a more or less extensive collection, according to the time or penetration that has been applied to the consideration of them. Where this process, conducted more or less mechanically, so to speak, will end, cannot be determined with certainty. Besides, the conceptions which we  discover in this haphazard manner present themselves by no means in order and systematic unity, but are at last coupled together only according to resemblances to each other, and arranged in series, according to the quantity of their content, from the simpler to the more complex--series which are anything but systematic, thought not altogether without a certain kind of method in their construction.

This lack of certainty is the same conundrum as that found in Bernard of Clairvaux. Almost all paths, almost all solutions, are less than optimal. On top of this lack of certainty Kant adds a lack of unity, and a lack of order in the conclusions about reality. The fundamental spontaneity of our understanding, when it comes to dealing with abstractions, makes it difficult to ensure that our logical operations end with something unified, orderly, and certain.

> Transcendental philosophy has the advantage, and moreover the duty, of searching for its conceptions according to a principle; because these conceptions spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding as an absolute unity, and therefore must be connection with each other according to one conception or idea. A conception of this kind, however, furnishes us with a ready prepared rule, by which its proper place may be assigned to every pure conception of the understanding and the completeness of the system of all be determined *a priori*--both which would have been dependent on mere choice or chance.

Here Kant explains how his approach is different and how it leads to more certainty.

> Here, as everywhere else, human reason in its pure use--so long as it lacks a critique--pursues every possible wrong way before it succeeds in finding the only right one. Groundwork, p. 109
 
> Lack of power, that was our dilemma. Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 45



> If a mere code of morals or a better philosophy of life were sufficient to overcome alcoholism, many of us would have recovered long ago. But we found that such codes and philosophies did not save us, no matter how much we tried. We could wish to be moral, we could wish to be philosophically comforted, in fact, we could will these things with all our might, but the needed power wasnâ€™t there. Our human resources, as marshalled by the will, were not sufficient; they failed utterly. AA p. 45

> Now man actually find in himself a power which distinguishes him from all other things--and even from himself so far as he is affected by objects. This power is reason. As pure spontaneity reason is elevated even above understanding in the following respect. Understanding--although it too is spontaneous activity and is not, like sense, confined to ideas which arise only when we are affected by things (and therefore are passive)--understanding cannot produce by its own activity any concepts other than those whose sole service is to bring sensuous ideas under rules and so to unite them in one consciousness: whithout this employment of sensibility it would think nothing at all. Reason, on the other hand--in what are called 'Ideas'--shows a spontaneity so pure that it goes far beyond anything sensibility can offer: it manifests its highest function in distinguishing the sensible and intelligible worls from one another and so in marking out limits for understanding itself. Groundwork, p. 119-20.


> Necessity and universality, therefore, are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empirical knowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other. (Kant, CPR, Introduction, II)

** The Necessity of Reason

> For geometrical principles are always apodeictic, that is, united with the consciousness of their necessity, as: "Space has only three dimensions."
