## Tradeoffs, Combinations, and Uncertainty

As programmers, we have to make choices. That's normal. What is weirder is that habitually, our minds are already choosing to pay attention in some ways and not pay attention in other ways. That sets us up for tradeoffs that have been made, but we're unaware of it. We can't pay attention to all the things all the time. So our mind naturally filters out certain perceptions and prefers certain kinds of thinking, just so we can not be overwhelmed by the chaos.

At the same time, in order to accomplish our goals in developing software, we need to be able to put things together, to combine them. While certain things must be tradeoffs, and can never be combined, other things must be combined if we are to be successful. We can't just write code and not test it, for instance. Similarly, with our habits of attention, we need to be able to attend to different things and synthesize the different aspects into one working solution. We can't just stay in our heads. We need to make sure we're looking at all the necessary data, that we're asking all the necessary questions.

Finally, all of this would be hard enough if we perfect knowledge of every situation. But we don't. We get unclear requirements,
