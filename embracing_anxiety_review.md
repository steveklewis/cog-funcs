# Embracing Anxiety - A Review

I just finished reading Karla McLaren's _Embracing Anxiety_. I want to offer my review of the book, but first, I want to introduce myself as a reader of Karla McLaren. When I was going through a mid-life crisis, several years ago, I discovered I needed to get more in touch with my feelings. Somehow, I lucked out and came upon Karla McLaren's book, _The Language of Emotions_. I've read it multiple times over the past few years, and it has helped me understand what emotions are for, and how to understand what each emotion is trying to tell me.

In addition, I've also read Karla's book _The Art of Empathy_, which is just a great book. But what I'm really here to discuss is Karla's latest book, _Embracing Anxiety_. It's a smaller and shorter work than her two previous book on emotion, but it's packed full of tools and concepts to become even more aware of how to embrace your emotions.

In Karla McLaren's first book, _The Language of Emotions_, she outlines the emotions as clear distinct categories. One of the best things about _Embracing Anxiety_ is she takes it to the next level and really dives into the relationships between our emotions, and how we can move intelligently between various pairings of other emotions and anxiety. This is sort of like learning about Carl Jung's cognitive functions, and then later on learning how each cognitive function interacts with each other. Mastering the relationships between the emotions gives our skills with emotions a new subtlety and power that we didn't have before.
