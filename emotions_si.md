# Emotions, Feelings, and Cognitive Functions

## Emotions as a Problem: Modeling the Emotional Process

What is it about our emotions that they come to us and we find them so hard to understand? Can the Cognitive Functions offer us a way to model emotions that would be helpful in understanding what is going on? I believe so. A model would give us the ability to parse our emotions more effectively, identify each one as they arise, and glean the information contained within each emotions. This process can also help us understand which piece of the puzzle we might be missing in processing our emotions.

## Reflecting on Emotions

> The first question which occurs in considering our representations is to what faculty of cognition do they belong? To the understanding or to the senses?

What Kant is trying to say is that our representations, our perceptions, come to us and we can sort them into whether they are more concrete or are they more abstract. To me, it seems that our emotions come from our bodies, from our metaphorical gut, and from there we are giving the task of making sense of them. Because of that if we had to choose between concrete or abstract, we would say our emotions are concrete perceptions.

Within the world of Cognitive Functions, concrete perception is found within the categories of Introverted Sensing and Extraverted Sensing. This then brings up whether to categorize our emotions as an inner sense or an outer sense. To me, it seems more likely that our emotions come to us as inner sensations. Therefore, as we reflect on what emotions mean to us we can see they are a part of our inner sensations, and fit within the category of Introverted Sensing.

## Judging our Emotions: from Emotion to Conscious Feeling

Now that we have classified our emotions as a Cognitive Function, what do we do with the raw data of emotions. For many of us, we have come to believe that our emotions necessitate a certain kind of behavior. For instance, anger requires fighting, or fear requires fleeing. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can take a step back from our emotions and try to understand what they are trying to tell us, especially during times when our emotions are not as strong.

If we know anything about Cognitive Functions, we know that there are Perceiving Functions and Judging Functions. We've already identified the Perceiving Function for emotions: Introverted Sensing. So we need to consider which Judging Function is most likely to be used when we deal with our emotions. Since we are dealing with a concrete Perceiving Function, we will need to pick up one or both of the Extraverted Judging Functions. We know that Extraverted Judging Functions can process concrete data, so that leaves us with the choice of either Extraverted Feeling or Extraverted Thinking.

Ni = Fe(Si)

or

Ni = Te(Si)

Now, that's not the whole story, because Extraverted Judging Functions are synthetical, and synthesize information from both the abstract world and the physical world. In this case, these judging functions synthesize what the principles we already know, with the new information coming from the inner sense of our emotions. They take both Ni and Si, in order to create new knowledge about our present emotions. Accordingly, we can update our equations:

Ni = Fe(Ni, Si)

or

Ni = Te(Ni, Si)


This is in theory clearer but having Ni on both sides of the equation is a bit confusing. The Ni on the right side of the equation represents the abstractions that we already employ. It represents what we already believe about emotions and feelings. In essense, the things we already believe about emotion and feelings make up a model. Our internal model of emotion and feeling makes us see emotion and feeling and ourselves from a certain perspective. Our view of emotion determines what we can consciously draw from our feelings.

The Ni on the left side of the equation represents the new abstractions and information that we learn from our feelings. If we sense that we are sad, and that comes to our conscious awareness, the left side Ni might contain something like, "I am sad right now, about losing that thing that I had." So we can make our equations more explicit about what is going on here:


Ni of our conscious feeling = Fe(the model in our head of how emotions work, Si)

or

Ni of our conscious feeling = Te(the model in our head of how emotions work, Si)

So which Cognitive Function is more likely to do the actual work of synthesizing what we know and our emotion?
