# Introverted Intuition and Introverted Sensing - Two Libraries


What's difficult about these two are that they are hard to change. Events happened in the past. That's impossible to change. And abstractions, once they are realized in code, are hard to change.
# Rules and Exceptions - Introverted Intuition and Introverted Sensing for Programmers

As programmers, we deal with rules all the time. The business tells us what the rules need to follow.

As programmers, we deal with exceptions all the time. Sometimes, even the language we code in has exceptions baked into the language. But what are exceptions, really? Exceptions are singular events that happen outside of the system of rules we thought we had set up as we coded the program.


Why does this distinction matter? Why is this abstraction important? Because even though exceptions shouldn't happen, if that behavior is unspecified, it's like our program is unconscious and unaware of what could happen. We need to convert those possible exceptions into explicit rules, agreed upon by the business.

Unconsciousness, shadow, etc as applied to a program.
