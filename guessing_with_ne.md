# Guessing with Extraverted Intuition

If you have conscious Extraverted Intuition, and unconscious Introverted Intuition, you have to guess. Here's how I use it every day as a programmer:

First, a new feature is required or a bug crops up. I have to figure out how I want to first set out, with very little information. Before I take that first step, I generate a set of alternatives for implementing the feature or patching the bug. I ask myself, "What could be the root cause of this bug?" I don't have enough information yet, and I will get more as I go along this process, but I need to start looking somewhere.

By itself, Extraverted Intuition will not select from a set of alternatives. All it can do is generate options. That means it requires me to make an educated guess, based on experience or what I know to be true, as to where to begin and take that first step.
