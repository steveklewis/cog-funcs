# Why Cognitive Functions?

I didn't want to code anymore. I was bored, frustrated, annoyed, tired. I wasn't having fun anymore. Which was too bad, because that's a good part of the reason I went into software: because I enjoyed it, and I was halfway decent at it. These feelings made me ask questions I thought I'd never ask, like, "Do I want to be a programmer anymore?" I always thought I'd want to code until I'm 80 years old. I'm telling you my story because it turns out alright; the ending is a good ending. And since it has a good ending, I will recount what I learned on that journey. It was hard for me to figure out how I'd even gotten to that difficult point in my life, personally and professionally. But I began to search for better tools that would help me out of my predicament, and the most powerful tool I ran across in my search were the eight cognitive functions, first defined by Carl Jung.

## A Programmer's Journey - Which Path?

So what did the cognitive functions bring? Clarity. Clarity of thought. I was a mess of emotions and I didn't know how to sort them out. I was anxious about the future, confused about the past. I didn't have a way to sort through which thoughts were which. I didn't have a way to figure out the things I had been ignoring, to my own detriment. I didn't have a method or any tools by which to either stay on the path I already was on or to select a new path. Cognitively, I was way fuzzier than I needed to be to make effective decisions. 

And this question, "Which path should I take?" is one that we, as programmers, have to answer on a regular basis. New technologies come out, new features need to be written, our team sees people come and go, and sometimes we're the one that leaves one team and joins another. Sometimes we look up from what we were doing and find ourselves on no team at all. So we need tools for pathfinding. I believe that the cognitive functions are effective as a tool for pathfinding because they are a small set of categories.

John Beebe has explained what Jung viewed as the point of congitive functions:

> "... (Jung) had emphasized that the theory of psychological types should not be used as a way of classifying people but for "sorting out the empirical material" that comes up in the course of a therapeutic analysis. The method of analysis that results has the advantage of enabling a patient to see where a particular complex lives in the psyche."

## Cognitive Functions Are For Sorting

As software programmers, we deal with sorting every day. But we get a lot of empirical data in our jobs. Some related to our systems, some related to the people we work with, and some related to ourselves. The job is complicated. Many times the categories we use to sort things out are fully adequate, and we know what we're doing. But sometimes we need a different way of looking at things, to make sense of the information that's coming in. The Cognitive Functions are categories, made for sorting.

Categories are crucial for making sense of the world. They allow us to perceive different kinds of things, as well as attaching significance to the things that we perceive. The cognitive functions, in particular, are categories that describe how we relate to the world, ourselves, and other people. They can help answer questions we encounter every day, in software development and in the real world, such as:

1. What just happened?
1. What is going on?
1. What might happen?
1. What did I miss?
1. What are my strengths?
1. What should I focus on?

## Cognitive Functions Bring Clarity

I've found, in my own life, that Cognitive Functions have been invaluable in helping me to decide to stick it out as a software programmer. I've rediscovered the joy I found in paying attention to the ideas in my head so that I can solve a programming problem. Central to that rediscovery was learning how to think through the categories of the Cognitive Functions so that I could sort out the "empirical material." I hope now you can see why one might want to get to know the Cognitive Functions. Next, we'll cover what they actually consist of.
