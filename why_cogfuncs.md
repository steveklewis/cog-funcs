# Why Cognitive Functions?

I didn't want to code anymore. I was bored, frustrated, annoyed, tired. I wasn't having fun anymore. Which was too bad, because that's a good part of the reason I went into software: because I enjoyed it, and I was halfway decent at it. These feelings made me ask questions I thought I'd never ask, like, "Do I want to be a programmer anymore?" I always thought I'd want to code until I'm 80 years old. I'm telling you my story because it turns out alright; the ending is a good ending. And since it has a good ending, I will recount what I learned on that journey. It was hard for me to figure out how I'd even gotten to that difficult point in my life, personally and professionally. But I began to search for better tools that would help me out of my predicament, and the most powerful tool I ran across in my search were the eight cognitive functions, first defined by Carl Jung.

## A Programmer's Journey - Which Path?

So what did the cognitive functions bring? Clarity. Clarity of thought. I was a mess of emotions and I didn't know how to sort them out. I was anxious about the future, confused about the past. I didn't have a way to sort through which thoughts were which. I didn't have a way to figure out the things I had been ignoring, to my own detriment. I didn't have a method or any tools by which to either stay on the path I already was on or to select a new path. Cognitively, I was way fuzzier than I needed to be to make effective decisions. 

And this question, "Which path should I take?" is one that we, as programmers, have to answer on a regular basis. New technologies come out, new features need to be written, our team sees people come and go, and sometimes we're the one that leaves one team and joins another. Sometimes we look up from what we were doing and find ourselves on no team at all. So we need tools for pathfinding. I believe that the cognitive functions are effective as a tool for pathfinding because they are a small set of categories.

## Cognitive Functions as Relational Categories

Categories are crucial for making sense of the world. They allow us to perceive different kinds of things, as well as attaching significance to the things that we perceive. The cognitive functions, in particular, are categories that describe how we relate to the world, ourselves, and other people. Cognitive functions are relational categories. 

Another way to understand these categories is to think of them as jargon. As programmers, we deal with jargon all the time. We know that naming things is one of the hardest things to do, and we try our best to choose names that make the most sense and don't collide with other important concepts that we're also using. We also know that we can't start the naming process over every time we want to hash things out. And so, over time, a technical jargon is constructed that contains the common concepts that we need to draw from in order to communicate effectively and efficiently. Similarly, I have found that Cognitive Functions are a very useful set of terminology, as it helps people on teams get to know each other better, and discuss things that aren't always easy to discuss like personal perspectives. Accordingly, I want to emphasize cognitive functions as a cultural tool, a common lingo for talking about attention. Because that in itself is valuable if I have a way to communicate to you and to my coworkers about what I'm paying attention to. Perhaps I'm paying attention to the wrong thing. Perhaps you can help direct my attention to something that will more quickly help me do my job.

Finally, the cognitive functions are weird categories. They're unlike anything I've ever run across in my life. But only the weirdest categories can make you look at the world in a different way. And more than anything else at the time, I needed a new way of looking at the world, and myself. And I believe that these categories can be helpful in allowing us, as programmers, to find valuable paths for solving the problems we have to deal with every day.

## Cognitive Functions as Model

As software programmers, we deal with models everyday. Programming models, models of the world, data models, behavioral models. But not everyone loves models. In their book, __Nine Lies About Work__, Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall talk about how participating in leadership training and development can seem exciting at first, when hearing about the charisma and efficacy of dynamic leaders, and then "a facilitator steps to the front of the room and explains *the model*. The model takes whatever we've just seen and experienced and makes it boring" (p. 222). Which is funny, because I'm wanting to introduce you to a model. What can I say? I'm a programmer. I think in models.

What model is that? Well, it's very similar to a data structure we use every day. It's an array of arrays, or a list of lists. Each cognitive function describes a particular relationship with the world, or myself, or others. But there are also particular relationships between each cognitive function. Which means that the cognitive functions serve as a model that describes the relationships between relational categories. It's not recursive, it's just two levels deep.

This list of lists makes up a model that describes how we relate to the world, ourselves, and others in terms of how we pay attention:

1. We can't consciously attend to everything at once.
1. Certain kinds of attention can go together. Certain kinds of attention are exclusive.
1. These different kinds of attention allow us to develop our strengths, and conversly, our weaknesses.
1. Different people preferring different kinds of attention leads to conflict.
1. Understanding what other people use as categories can go a long way in reducing conflict.

This model also explains why we can get into trouble in software projects. Sometimes it's a technical issue. Many times it's an interpersonal issue. But we have to be able to see the situations we find ourselves in, in a different way. We're having to be creative to implement features within the constraints we are given, we need new methods and new tools to find the right paths. I believe understanding this model of cognitive functions can give us extra pathfinding power, by paying attention to how we pay attention.
