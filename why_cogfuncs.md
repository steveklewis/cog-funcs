# Why Cognitive Functions?

Why learn about cognitive functions? Why take the time to learn an inaccurate and fuzzy model of personality

## Cognitive Functions as Relational Categories

Categories are crucial for making sense of the world. They allow us to perceive different kinds of things, as well as attaching significance to the things that we perceive. The cognitive functions, in particular, are categories that describe how we relate to the world, ourselves, and other people. And the cognitive functions are weird categories. They're unlike anything I've ever run across in my life. But only the weirdest categories can make you look at the world in a different way.




## Cognitive Functions as Jargon

Cognitive Functions are not scientific. They don't model the world in a way that's scientifically predictable. If anything, they are philosophical categories. But I want to emphasize cognitive functions as a cultural tool, a common lingo for talking about attention. Because that in itself is valuable if I have a way to communicate to you and to my coworkers about what I'm paying attention to. Perhaps I'm paying attention to the wrong thing. Perhaps you can help direct my attention to something that will more quickly help me do my job.

As programmers, we deal with jargon all the time. We know that naming things is one of the hardest things to do, and we try our best to choose names that make the most sense and don't collide with other important concepts that we're also using.

## Cognitive Functions as Model

As software programmers, we deal with models everyday. Programming models, models of the world, data models, behavioral models. But not everyone loves models. In their book, <u>Nine Lies About Work</u>, Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall talk about how training and development can seem exciting at first, when hearing about dynamic leaders, and then "a facilitator steps to the front of the room and explains <i>the model</i>. The model takes whatever we've just seen and experienced and makes it boring" (p. 222). Which is funny, because I'm wanting to introduce you to a model. Cognitive functions describe a model of attention that says certain things about attention:

1. We can't pay attention to everything at once.
1. Certain kinds of attention can go together. Certain kinds of attention are exclusive.
1. These different kinds of attention allow us to develop our strengths, and conversly, our weaknesses.
1. Different people preferring different kinds of attention leads to conflict.
1. Understanding what other people use as categories can go a long way in reducing conflict.



Not everybody wants to learn a model, even if it might improve their lives. And most
