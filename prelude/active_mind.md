# You Need an Active Mind

## The Sedentary Mind

We've all been there. All your friends are in the car, they're hungry, they're ready to go somewhere, but no one has an opinion on where to go. Usually your friends will argue, rather than all being indecisive. But there you are. Someone finally forms an opinion and just because no one else has put a different idea forward, that's where we go.

When I was feeling lost, I didn't know where to begin. I was in the desert. Ideologically and metaphorically, everything looked the same. I had no landmarks to go by. I'd never been here before. I was free to go in any direction I wanted, but I didn't know what I wanted, and I had no idea of how to begin to choose a direction. My inactive mind was sedentary. I had gotten comfortable, I wasn't really moving forward in anything, except time. Things were being taken care of, but there was no direction or structure.

## The Inertial Mind

The inactive mind is also inertial, that is, while it is moving, it is not moving using its own power. It's like my brain was sitting on a comfy chair in space, floating in the same direction until the end of time. I wasn't receiving or searching for any new information, I was relying on things I already knew to deal with the problems I had, and they just weren't up to the task.

One of the things that surprised me when I read Immanuel Kant's _Critique of Pure Reason_ last year was just how active his interpretation of mind was. The mind doesn't just perceive and then tell our bodies what to do. It organizes, it sorts, it structures, it filters, it synthesizes. I wasn't just an observer and and passive actor in this world. I had the ability to actively operate on the information that I was receiving from the world about the world, myself, and others. And it struck me, "I need to take on a much more active role when it comes to my mind. I need an active mind."

The first habit in Stephen Covey's _Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_ is "Be Proactive." He recommends figuring out what you can control and focusing on that, which is great advice. But I needed something even easier than becoming proactive. I had to find the minimum amount of effort I could exert to get me moving in a different direction. To me, even easier than being proactive is to begin to think. To move the mind.

## An Active Mind Embraces Difference and Makes Distinctions

I have to admit, I didn't really understand what this meant. It's more than just being proactive. It's having the mindset to search, and sort, and summarize the ideas and experiences you consume. One thing I learned about the feeling of being lost is that I got out of the habit of doing anything structured with the seeking that I was doing.

One thing that doesn't help is seeing all things as one. Oneness, while a fascinating idea, isn't helpful when finding a new direction. Whether you wake up in a dark forest, or a desert, or a snowy, mountainous region, the problem is that everything looks the same, and because it all looks the same, you don't know where to go. 

## An Active Mind Has Opinions

What's your favorite color? Do you have one? Perhaps it doesn't matter. In the wider perspective of one's entire life, your favorite color doesn't really matter. But you need to practice making distinctions and having opinions. And you can't have well-formed, well-practiced opinions of a higher, more abstract order if you haven't started with simpler, easier opinions. Because what truly matters are your opinions about truth, and value, and you can't really have opinions on the most meaningful questions if you haven't climbed the ladder from questions like your favorite color. So, in my view, your favorite color really is a question that does matter.

## An Active Mind Embraces Strife

Empedocles, the pre-Socratic philosopher, said that things get their form from the power of strife: "In Strife all things are, endued with form and separate from each other." Strife brings form, and definition, and clarity. But I hated strife. I much preferred Empedocles' other power, that of love: "they come together in Love and are desired by each other." As an INFP and an Enneagram Nine, I have historically done my best avoid the strife within conflicts. But the mind needs something to push against, something to disturb the inertia, something to bring clarity to cloudy thinking. And that missing formative power really is the angry energy within strife.

## An Active Mind Embraces Complexity

There are many times in my life when I've felt that the world is just way too complicated. I want to leave the complex world and become a monk and go live in a cave somewhere. Yet even that would be a different kind of complexity. The chaos of the world can't always be contained, but there are ways to find a boat in the flood, and an active mind is much more equipped to find that boat than a passive mind.
