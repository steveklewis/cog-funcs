# You Need to Know Your Strengths and Weaknesses

After my first article on advice, I began to write up some of the things I've learned in my own process towards clarity. But then, a question posed itself to me: what would it take for someone to not feel lost? Perhaps it is different for each person. But in a general sense the basic structure seems to be the same: in order to find a new direction you need to figure out what strengths you have and how to leverage those in a different way from what you are used to doing.

## Advice About Strengths

One of the first pieces of advice that I got early on in this particular journey was that I needed to focus on my strengths. But I had no idea what it meant. I didn't even know my strengths. I was a pretty good programmer. Not the best, not the worst. Honestly, it was really the only thing I ever felt I did pretty well in my life. So while that piece of advice wasn't bad, it wasn't especially helpful at the time.

At some point a little later on I went and took the StrengthsFinder test, and got as my five strengths: Empathy, Intellection, Connectedness, Input, Adaptability. That seemed accurate enough, but I had no idea what to do with it. It would be years before I was able to make sense of that. Even after learning some of my strengths, it wasn't clear what to make of it, or what to do with it. 

I remember years ago taking the MBTI and getting INFP as the result. Which seemed right, but I didn't know what to do with it. I was idealistic, yes, but trying to translate that into the business world seemed like an impossibility. And I sure didn't connect to the career suggestions for INFPs. I wasn't an artist. I wasn't going to be a therapist. I wasn't a teacher. I wasn't a writer. I was in the health-care industry, which did feed a certain amount of my innate values. But overall, the MBTI didn't seem to be much help.


## Strengths Are Abstract

A few years later I began to really study the intricacies of personality traits and personality types, and I discovered that strengths are abstractions, and you have to do the work to fill in the blanks. By themselves, without some serious self-analysis, you won't be able to connect your strengths to a new mission.

Part of the reason strengths are abstract to us is because we use our strengths without thinking about them. Our strengths are like axioms. They are the assumptions you bring to your career. Without them you wouldn't have even gotten into your career. But there is a strength or multiple strengths that you have that you aren't leveraging. There is immense potential in those strengths if you can make the time to identify them. It's the part of you that if you really pressed the pedal to the medal, your strengths could take you further and faster than you have been going.


## Weaknesses Are Concrete

Everyone knows what their weaknesses are. We consciously focus on our weaknesses all the time, because they kick our butts on a regular basis. The funny thing is we try to give our weaknesses the least amount of attention possible. But there are certain kinds of weaknesses that become strengths because we focus on them consistently over a long period of time. One day we wake up and the thing that's most difficult for us is the thing we can teach others about, and since it's a weakness, we can connect with others over it. That kind of weakness I'm going to call a mastered weakness.


## Attention Determines Your Strengths and Weaknesses

You've already been honing your strengths. It's the manner in which you pay attention. Whatever you pay attention to, that general direction of your attention will get stronger.
Whatever you pay attention to, you'll get stronger, until you've exhausted a particular aspect of reality. Then you can keep doing it again and again, but it won't get stronger, it will just stay the same. To get stronger you have to do something slightly different, to use your strength...

One of the things I didn't understand was that strengths stand in contradistinction to weaknesses. Certain strengths require certain weaknesses, and vice versa.



## Making Strengths Concrete

Focusing your strength on something concrete is like choosing a college major in mid-life. You've already specialized to a certain extent, and you would like to specialize in something else, possibly. Now, as we know from scientific studies, skills aren't transferable. You can't study chess and become a better programmer. But patterns of attention are transferable. If we enjoy paying attention in a certain way to task A, and task B requires the same manner of attention, we may not be good at it yet, but we will enjoy the process of getting good at it. That's why if you can view a strength as a pattern of attention, you can take that pattern and apply it to a totally different field.




## Making Weaknesses Abstract

Your mastered weakness can give direction. It can give purpose, to help others where you have struggled. Part of the reason I felt so lost was that all I could see was my struggles, and I didn't know how to contextualize them into a greater narrative. Somehow we have to give more abstraction to our concrete weaknesses.



## Your Innate Strengths And Your Mastered Weaknesses Give You Direction

Your innate strengths and mastered weaknesses narrow down your range of options. That, by itself, makes you less lost, even if you don't feel it yet.

One of my strengths is that I'm very close to my own emotions. I don't handle them well, and I don't always pay attention to what they're saying, but I'm a feeler and I know exactly how I'm feeling. But there are times when it gets too intense and gets more confusing than clarifying. I had to find a better way of understanding my emotions, because for me, without that, I was just going to keep getting stuck in them. That closeness is an innate strength that I wasn't leveraging. I needed to learn how to navigate my emotions with more wisdom.

Recently, I took another personality type test called StandOut 2.0. My top two results were "Teacher" and "Provider."
