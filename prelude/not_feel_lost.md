# You Need to Know What It Will Take to Not Feel Lost

After my first article on advice, I began to write up some of the things I've learned in my own process towards clarity. But then, a question posed itself to me: what would it take for someone to not feel lost? Perhaps it is different for each person. But in a general sense the basic structure seems to be the same: in order to find a new direction you need to figure out what strengths you have and how to leverage those in a different way from what you are used to doing.

## You Need to Know Your Strengths and Weaknesses

One of the first pieces of advice that I got early on in this particular journey was that I needed to focus on my strengths. But I had no idea what it meant. I didn't even know my strengths. I was a pretty good programmer. Not the best, not the worst. Honestly, it was really the only thing I ever felt I did pretty well in my life. So while that piece of advice wasn't bad, it wasn't especially helpful at the time.

At some point a little later on I went and took the StrengthsFinder test, and got as my five strengths: Empathy, Intellection, Connectedness, Input, Adaptability. That seemed accurate enough, but I had no idea what to do with it. It would be years before I was able to make sense of that. Even after learning some of my strengths, it wasn't clear what to make of it, or what to do with it.

I remember years ago taking the MBTI and getting INFP as the result. Which seemed right, but I didn't know what to do with it. I was idealistic, yes, but trying to translate that into the business world seemed like an impossibility. And I sure didn't connect to the career suggestions for INFPs. I wasn't an artist. I wasn't going to be a therapist. I wasn't a teacher. I was in the health-care industry, which did feed a certain amount of my innate values. I wasn't a writer. So the MBTI didn't seem to be much help.

## Strengths Are Abstract, Weaknesses Are Concrete

A few years later I began to really study the intricacies of personality traits and personality types, and I discovered that strengths are abstractions, and you have to do the work to fill in the blanks. By themselves, without some serious self-analysis, you won't be able to connect your strengths to a new mission.

Part of the reason strengths are abstract to us is because we do them without thinking about them. They are the assumptions you bring to your career. Without them you wouldn't have even gotten into your career. And in order to grow and to find your next career move you need to stop always depending on your strengths, because there is data you are completely ignoring and disregarding. And there are ways of evaluating the world that you have almost never used.

One of my strengths is that I'm very in-tune with my own emotions. I don't handle them well, and I don't always pay attention to what they're saying, but I'm a feeler and I know exactly how I'm feeling. But there are times when it gets too intense and gets more confusing than clarifying. I had to find a better way of understanding my emotions, because for me, without that, I was just going to keep getting stuck in them.

## Making Strengths Concrete

1. Abstract strategy that gets you in the right ballpark of your strengths.
1. Concrete goal that attempts to realize that abstract strategy that makes sense for you.
1. Emotional boundaries arrived at by improving one's emotional skills.
1. Conceptual tools for navigating towards the concrete goal.
One of the presuppositions of getting as lost as you've gotten, is you've ignored certain things about yourself and about your situation.
For me, a lot became clearer when I had an abstract strategy and a concrete way to work that out. I found out I was an abstract creator. I later on found out I needed to express myself and teach people what little I knew.
