# You Need to Know Your Strengths Are Abstract

After my first article on [advice](advice.md), I began to write up some of the things I've learned in my own process away from confusion and towards clarity. But then, a question posed itself to me: what would it take for someone to not feel lost? Perhaps it is different for each person. But in a general sense the basic structure seems to be the same: in order to find a new direction you need to figure out what strengths you have and how to leverage those in a different way from what you are used to doing.

## Advice About Strengths

One of the first pieces of advice that I got early on in this particular journey was that I needed to focus on my strengths. But I had no idea what it meant. I didn't even know my strengths. I was a pretty good programmer. Not the best, not the worst. Honestly, it was really the only thing I ever felt I did pretty well in my life. So while that piece of advice wasn't bad, it wasn't especially helpful at the time.

At some point a little later on I went and took the StrengthsFinder test, and got as my five strengths: Empathy, Intellection, Connectedness, Input, Adaptability. That seemed accurate enough, but I had no idea what to do with it. It would be years before I was able to make sense of that. Even after learning some of my strengths, it wasn't clear what to make of it, or what to do with it. 

I remember years ago taking the MBTI and getting INFP as the result. Which seemed right, but I didn't know what to do with it. I was idealistic, yes, but trying to translate that into the business world seemed like an impossibility. And I sure didn't connect to the career suggestions for INFPs. I wasn't an artist. I wasn't going to be a therapist. I wasn't a teacher. I wasn't a writer. I was in the health-care industry, which did feed a certain amount of my innate values. But overall, the MBTI didn't seem to be much help.


## Skills are Concrete, but Strengths Are Abstract

A few years later I began to really study the intricacies of personality traits and personality types, and I discovered that strengths are abstractions. One of the things I didn't fully understand was that programming isn't a strength. It's a skill. Strengths are like rooms in a house, and skills are the things that you do in that room.

What happens when you walk into a room? What do you see? What do you expect? Who is there? Why are you there? What is the room for? Does it have a single function? Or a list of functions you could choose from? Let's take a kitchen. There's no one concrete thing that you do in a kitchen. In general it's for preparing food, but it's also for storing food, in the refrigerator, and storing utensils and pots and pans. You can cook in kitchen. You can clean in a kitchen. You can wash dishes in a kitchen. There's no one kitchen-related skill that you could master that sums up what a kitchen is. That's how a strength is.

From a certain perspective, it makes sense to categorize programming as an abstraction at the level of a room. After all, there are many ways to program. You can use various programming languages, work on various problems, in various business verticals, using various operating systems, with different databases, and so on. It's not one concrete thing. But just because programming can be considered as an abstraction, doesn't mean that it's at the same level of abstraction as a strength.

This distinction is important, otherwise you will confuse your skills and your strengths, and you won't be able to recognize your strengths as pointers to new skills. You want to pair your existing skill with another skill that falls within the same strength. For instance, you probably wouldn't pair something like programming with underwater basketweaving. There's not enough commonality, even at an abstract level. Finding another skill that falls within the same strength allows you to synthesize in a meaningful way the two skills so that each is more fluent, more flexible, and more nuanced.

Part of the reason strengths are abstract to us is because we use our strengths without thinking about them. Our strengths are like axioms. They are the assumptions you bring to your career. Without them you wouldn't have even gotten into your career. But there is a strength or multiple strengths that you have that you aren't fully leveraging, where you can find new skills. There is immense potential in those strengths if you can make the time to identify them. It's the part of you that if you really pressed the pedal to the medal, your strengths could take you further and faster than you have been going.

The question is how to find a new direction. But you've already been choosing your direction, in a general way. You've already been honing your strengths. You like to work with your hands. Or you love languages and you love expressing yourself. Something general enough that can be applied across different skills.




## Making Your Strengths Interesting Again By Finding New Skills

What does it mean to make a strength interesting? It's to realize that your abstract strength applies to a new situation you haven't considered before. Focusing your strength on something different is like choosing a college major in mid-life. You've already specialized to a certain extent, and you would like to specialize in something else, possibly. Now, as we know from scientific studies, skills aren't transferable. You can't study chess and become a better programmer. But habits of attention are transferable. If we enjoy paying attention in a certain way to task A, and task B requires the same habit of attention, we may not be good at it yet, but we will enjoy the process of getting good at it. That's why if you can view a strength as a habit of attention, you can take that pattern and apply it to a totally different skill. Recognizing a new application of an old strength allows you to breathe new life into the old you, without sacrificing all the hard work you've put in, in the past.

As an example, let's take the strength of Intellection defined by StrengthsFinder 2.0 that I got as one of my strengths. In theory, I could use it to try to help me find a skill that also requires Intellection. Or, we could take the strength of Empathy to find a skill that's sort of like programming, but requires more Empathy.

## Your Chosen New Skills Give You Direction


One of my strengths is that I'm very close to my own emotions (i.e. the Empathy skill mentioned above). I don't handle them well, and I don't always pay attention to what they're saying, but I'm a feeler and I know exactly how I'm feeling. But there are times when it gets too intense and gets more confusing than clarifying. I had to find a better way of understanding my emotions, because for me, without that, I was just going to keep getting stuck in them. That closeness is an innate strength that I wasn't leveraging. I needed to learn how to navigate my emotions with more wisdom. Becoming more emotionally skilled has given me a particular direction that has ended up helping me in so many other areas.

Recently, I took another personality type test called StandOut 2.0. My top two results were "Teacher" and "Provider." Those two strengths I wasn't aware of before, but I can see skills that I can learn to make better use of them. As a provider, I like to make a space for ideas that haven't been heard before. And as a teacher, I need to communicate the things I've learned, even without changing my career.

Hopefully you can see the pattern, and you can see how you can follow it. That is the path that I've had to take to make more sense of my life at work. It hasn't been an easy or a quick route, precisely because it was so abstract, but I didn't know what I wanted. I just knew I wanted something different at work.
