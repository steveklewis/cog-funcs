# You Need to Feel Your Feelings

## Dissociation

[Dissociation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology)). It's the psychological term for not feeling your emotions. Sometimes, that's what you're really doing. You're trying to be present, or focus on what you need to focus on, but there's something that's distracting you, or telling you it's not okay to feel that right now. I didn't know what it was, but it's a natural part of emotional life. There are times when we don't know what's going on, when we don't know what we're feeling, and we don't have time to slow down and process. But we can't dissociate forever. Our bodies and emotions simply won't allow for that.

## Dissociative Practices

One of the not-so-great things in life as you try to learn from your mistakes and look for helpful resoureces is that there's are certain kinds of practices end up being dissociative. Even well-intentioned theories and practices may tell you why to deal with your feelings, or that you do need to feel your feelings, but if they don't tell you how, it's still a mystery. Add that great advice isn't helpful if it assumes you know how.

I want to say that it is necessary for you to feel your feelings. Because not everyone says that, and not all religious or spiritual programs even mention that. In fact, whether through a false masculinity or an abstract mysticism, if it never trains you to pay attention to your feelings, you're heading for emotional burnout. It also doesn't help that, in general, the social groups and organizations we are part of aren't very comfortable dealing with strong emotions, especially those that are typically categorized as "negative" emotions. My hope is that if we allow our emotions to rise and fall when they are less intense, they won't have to increase to maximum intensity in order to get our attention.

## Emotional Sobriety

One of the most interesting things I've learned in my research is that people who have had to get their inner life in order, so that they can survive, still aren't always emotionally mature. Bill W., the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, more than 20 years after he got sober, wrote on how he believed the next frontier of A.A. was [emotional sobriety](http://silkworth.net/pages/aahistory/general/emotionalsobriety.php). As an outsider, that is surprising to me because one would think that the serious and powerful spiritual tools to get someone sober are also adequate to getting emotional freedom. But without special attention to one's emotions, one's feelings don't automatically sort themselves out. And it's not just Bill W., there are testimonies of many A.A. members who were sober from alcohol for many, many years and only after those many years began to focus on their emotional life.

## The Next Frontier

My emotions don't always tell me the truth. I can't base my reality on it. But they *are* a part of that reality and the more I ignore them the worse it will be for me. I'm not a Stoic, nor do I endeavor to be. I don't want emotional mastery in any sense that keeps me from feeling what I need to feel. I want emotional freedom, such that I get to feel my feelings, learn what I can from them, and move to do the next right thing. My primary source for learning how to feel my emotions has been Karla McLaren's [The Language of Emotions](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Emotions-What-Feelings-Trying/dp/1591797691).

There are times when certain emotions are too powerful, and you need help working through those with a therapist or someone who knows how to deal with strong emotions. I'm not trained to walk anyone through that level of emotional distress, so if you need real, serious help, please find a professional.
