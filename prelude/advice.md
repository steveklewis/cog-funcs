# You Need 100 Times More Advice Than You Think You Need

When you are lost, you don't know what you don't know. You're not even sure where you are, let alone where you might want to go. And you're not exactly sure how you even got to this point. When I was going through my mid-life crisis, I wasn't depressed, really. I was more confused, and couldn't find a way through the fog. And there was no one really who could solve it for me. Because no one knows me like I know me, and no one knows you like you know you. And as confusing as oneself may be to onself, it's even more confusing for someone on the outside looking in. So, I had to go searching. But it was a lot more work, and took a lot more time, and was a lot more lonely, than I expected. Which leads me to my first point: you need a lot more advice than you think you need.

What do I mean by that? Most advice you can get, whether from a book or face-to-face, is not going to be directly relevant. Maybe it eventually will be helpful, but when you're lost, you don't know which piece of advice is going to be the next helpful step you need. The world is complex and filled with options. Infinite permutations await you. And even when people tell you the right thing to do or to know, you're not always in a position to accept or act on that advice. That's the funny thing about advice: it's usually either too abstract or to concrete. Let's break that down.

## Abstract Advice

A lot of the advice one can get may come in the form of platitudes or cliches. That doesn't mean they're not true, it just means that they are so removed from a concrete context that you probably don't see how it might apply to your situation. Or if you see how it could apply, you aren't able to put it into practice, for whatever reason. We see this all the time at the beginning of a movie. The protagonist hears a piece of advice, "Face your fears," or "believe in yourself," and it makes no impact at first, and only after going through the journey does the advice make any sense at all. What you really need from advice is course of action, suggesting actions that you would be willing to take that get you one step closer to clarity. Maybe the advice you receive is great advice, but you are unwilling or unable to take that advice for one year. What you need instead is your next step, customized to you and the moment you are in, right now.

## Concrete Advice

A different kind of problem with advice is that it can come as too concrete. It might be good advice, like "brush your teeth," but it fails to address the bigger picture. 



## Category Errors

Another point when advice is unhelpful is when it involves the wrong sphere of application. For me, my mid-life crisis primarily was one around my career. I got a lot of identity from my career, and when I couldn't figure out my next move and was floundering, I was unable to begin to look for customized career advice. It took me a long time to figure out that that was my problem. It wasn't primarily spiritual, or religious, or obviously health-related. It was about what I did, and what I wanted to do, and what I could do, and what I was good at, and what I could be good at.

## Digesting Advice

There are many reasons advice doesn't hit home. I've outlined three, but my primary point is that all of these things that keep advice from helping you mean that you need to consume 100 to 1000 times more advice than you will be able to digest. Without that amount of data you may not get what you need. And no one can force-feed you all the various solutions in the world. There's not enough hours spent at church, or on a therapist's couch in a week to get you the amount of advice that you need.





## Making Time and Putting in the Effort


You need to be able to consider advice and sort it into some sort of comprehensive system. For the too-concrete advice, you need to be able to add context to give a bigger picture. For the too-abstract advice, you need to be able to break down the steps you might need to take in order for it to become realized. For advice that's in the wrong ballpark, you need to figure out what your basic problem is and do your best to pay attention to the kind of advice that at least begins to address your primary confusion and primary fears.
