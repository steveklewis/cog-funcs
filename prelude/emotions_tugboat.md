# Motivation and Emotions

There are times in our lives when we feel lost because we're not sure where we are or where we are going. Strengths can begin to help with that. But there are also times when we know what we need to do but we are unable to muster the will-power to do the thing we need to do. Procrastination. The noonday demon. Laziness. Acedia. Sloth. You are like a ship out at sea, no wind in your sails. You have places to go, places to be, but there's no power. How do you get out of this predicament? There's a lot of good research on procrastination done by Tim Pychyl, and one of the major conclusions he has is that procrastination is about emotion management.

## Emotions: The Tugboat of Motivation

What if you could always find the motivation to do the thing you needed to do? Now, that's a very dangerous question, if you think about it. What if there was a button that you could push, or someone else could push, to get you to do something? It sounds crazy, but if you haven't consciously thought about who gets to push those buttons, you are allowing people who aren't trustworthy to push your buttons when they want something from you. They can push your fear button or your anger button to make money off of you. Ideally, you want to be the person to decide who gets to push your buttons. Hopefully, those are the people who love you and want the best for you.

When you want to do something, it's easy.  You just do it. But when you don't want to do something, the "negative" emotions creep in, and you have to figure out a way to accomplish that something without all the enjoyable emotions.

So you have to ask yourself, "What is the minimum amount of emotion I need for this task?" and "Which emotion is most clearly suited to getting me motivated for this task?"

One option is to only do things you want to do. That way you never have to do things you don't want to do. But unfortunately, this world is not very conducive to survival if you don't ever do something you don't want to do.

You can wait until you are at a maximum level of fear before halting your procrastination. Or you can find a way to allow another one of your emotions to kick in and find your motivation. Which on is it? How much of it is necessary?
