# You Need New Categories

I needed new ideas, new emotions, and new attitudes. I felt lost and the information that I had already collected over my years was no longer working. I didn't know exactly what that meant, but over time I've come to see that what I needed were new categories. The old categories underneath my old ideas, old emotions, and old attitudes were keeping me from growing. Our fundamental categories end up guiding our lives whether we know it or not.


For me, it has been easy to walk around in a fog. As an INFP, the Idealist or Mediator type, I've never really valued conceptual clarity. But when I felt my life wasn't going entirely in the right direction, I eventually came around to accepting the idea that I needed more conceptual clarity in my life.
Is a small set of categories trivial? I'd like to ask two major philosophers, Aristotle and Kant. Here are Aristotle's categories:

1. Substance
1. Quantity
1. Relational
1. Quality
1. Where
1. When
1. Being-in-a-position
1. Having
1. Doing
1. Being affected


It may be said that small sets of categories are trivial because no one can agree on them or on what they mean.

Kant's Categories:
two-dimensional

Quantity - Unity, Plurality, Totality
Quality - Reality, Negation, Limitation
Relation - Substance/Accidence, Cause/Effect, Community
Modality - Possibility/Impossibility, Existence/Non-Existence, Necessity/Contingency


Categories are the life-blood of the mind. The life of the mind requires categories.


1. Childhood influences (Burning Contracts) (categories)
2. Passions and interests                   (categories)
3. Talents and skills                       (categories)
4. Personality (MBTI)                       (categories)
5. Coincidences
6. Life-changing experience
7. Clarifying your purpose
8. Writing a manifesto
