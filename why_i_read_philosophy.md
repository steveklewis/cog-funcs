# Why I Read Philosophy

Ever since I started reading a book on Heidegger my roommate had left on his desk in our freshman apartment, I have been enamored with philosophy. But I haven't always made time to read philosophy. In college and through most of my twenties, I read Friedrich Nietzsche's work almost every day. My copy of The Joyful Science was well-worn, the plastic peeling away from the paperback cover. At some point, most likely because of the busyness of life, work, and family, I stopped reading philosophy on a regular basis. 

In order to keep my sense of wonder and inspiration so that I can continue to be creative, I need to maintain my connection to the realm of ideas. Without at least one foot in that realm, my spirit withers and begins to fade and lose its color.

My current interest in philosophy is primarily driven by my curiousity about how categories work. For instance, the cognitive functions are a set of categories about how we perceive and judge reality. There are multiple, multiple explanations of the cognitive functions on the internet. And almost everyone seems to have a slightly different definition of the cognitive functions. That conundrum has led me to wonder how one would even establish a solid set of definitions for cognitive functions.

One way would be to scientifically establish how cognitive functions appear behaviorally in the world, and tweak those until you end up with a eight definitions of particular behavior. But at this point they are not really definitions of cognition. They have mutated, in the process of verification, into definitions of clear, distinct behaviors.

But this sort of thinking made me wonder about how categories work. How are they constructed? How does one move from one category to another? Are they always disjoint, with no relation? Or is there a series of complex relationships between them?

This led me to think of another way of constructing definitions for the cognitive functions. One could attempt to philosophically map out the possible definitions of the cognitive functions according to categories that necessarily show up in our patterns of thought. In so doing the process would allow the categories to retain their status as categories relating to cognition.
