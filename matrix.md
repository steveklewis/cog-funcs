* The Kantian Matrix for Cognitive Functions

** The Distinction Between *a priori* and *a posteriori*

For Immanuel Kant, one of the major distinctions he tried to make was that between a priori and a posteriori cognitions. Those cognitions that we have without reference to concrete perceptions of the outside world, he termed *a priori*, before experience. Those cognitions that we have that reference the external, physical world, he termed *a posteriori*, after experience.
