* The Kantian Matrix for Cognitive Functions

In this essay I would like to share a schema that Immanuel Kant first came up with and used extensively in his first treatise, The Critique of Pure Reason. I believe that it was foundational to Jung's understanding of Cognitive Functions, since he was, philosophically, a Neo-Kantian. I hope that an explanation of some of Kant's terminology will help to illuminate what Jung was really trying to do when he named the eight Cognitive Functions, and so allow us to find better definitions for the eight categories.

** The Distinction Between *a priori* and *a posteriori*

For Immanuel Kant, one of the major distinctions he tried to make was that between a priori and a posteriori cognitions. Those cognitions that we have without reference to concrete perceptions of the outside world, he termed *a priori*, before experience. Those cognitions that we have that reference the external, physical world, he termed *a posteriori*, after experience.

** The Distinction Between Analytical and Synthetical

Kant also distinguishes between something he calls the analytical and the synethetical. The analytical are those modes of thought that only reference definitions and nothing outside of those definitions. The synthetical modes of thought bring in concepts or experiences outside of those definitions to add to already-known definitions.


| | analytical | synthetical |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| *a priori* | Ti, Fi, Ni |  Ti, Fi, Ni, Ne |
| *a posteriori* | Te, Fe, Ni, Si | Te, Fe, Se, Si, Ni |


** The First Quadrant: Analytical and *a priori*

In the analytical and *a priori* quadrant, we place the kind of thinking that pretends that all there is, is thinking. It references the kind of thinking Descartes was trying to do when he came up with, "I think, therefore I am." Thoughts are happening, therefore I exist. It is focused on the meanings within the definitions, and does not attempt to reference anything outside of those definitions.

This quadrant is also *a priori* because it has to reference to the material world. It focuses on the world of pure abstract definitions, or at least it pretends to. To me, that implies that in this quadrant we can experience Introverted Intuition, as the cognitive function representing abstract ideas, as well as the introverted judging functions, Introverted Thinking and Introverted Feeling. In this kind of thinking, Ti and Ni focus exclusively on the abstractions and attempt to not go outside of those strict logical boundaries.

** The Second Quadrant: Synthetical and *a priori*
