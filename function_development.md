# Developing a Cognitive Function

What does it even mean to develop a cognitive function? How do functions develop? Well it depends on the type of function.

For perceiving functions, developing one's function means consuming more data. Different tasks that we want to accomplish require that we look at certain kinds of data. Let's examine a task from four different perspectives.

### Extraverted Sensing

Let's say you're trying to fix a toilet. You might have to open it up and look at it. But you've never done that before. It might not occur to you to even open it up. But someone is going to have to look at it, if it's going to get fixed. Perhaps you call the plumber and he's the first one to look at it. Just looking at the raw physical data is Extraverted Sensing. You can't fix a toilet without it.

### Introverted Sensing

Let's say you call the plumber. He tries to flush the toilet but he hears a clink when he presses the lever. He's heard that sound before. He knows, without looking, that the problem is the disconnected chain between the flapper the the lever. He opens up the top of the toilet, verifies his guess, re-attaches the chain and charges you $75. That's Introverted Sensing. The plumber accessed his library of concrete information to realize he's dealt with this problem before.

### Extraverted Intuition

Let's say a friend comes over and uses your toilet. He tells you that the toilet's broken. Without looking at it, or asking him what it was doing, your mind jumps to what the problem might be. Will it end up being caused by that chain that the plumber fixed last time? That's Extraverted Intuition, jumping to the possibility without having all the concrete data.

### Introverted Intuition

Suppose you get tired of calling a plumber and you have regular problems with the toilet so you decide to sign up for an online course, "Contemporary Toilet Theory." You want to know how toilets work, in general, so you can diagnose any problem that might arise with the toilet. After taking the course, you now have an understanding, in an abstract way, of how a toilet should work. When someone tells you, "The toilet is broken," your mind generates not just one possibility, but all the possibilities of how it could be broken. You haven't experienced all toilet problems directly yourself, but you have the conceptual understanding of toilets so that you can make a very good educated guess. That's Introverted Intuition. It knows the abstract rules around toilets, and allows you to access your abstract library of information going forward.

For judging functions, it means increasing the complexity one can deal with. The world is complex. If you are having to integrate new information in this complex and chaotic world, but your cognitive functions aren't as complex as the information coming in, you won't be able to successfully figure out what to do with the information. You might just throw away the information.
