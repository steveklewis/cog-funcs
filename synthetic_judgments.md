# Synthetic Judgments

## The Basis for How Cognitive Functions Construct Thoughts

"Thoughts without content are empty; intuitions without concepts are blind."  Kant, Critique of Pure Reason


What Kant is telling us, if reformulated in typical cognitive function terminology, would be restated as "Perceptions without judgments are blind." Perceiving and judging come together to form a coherent concept, one that is interesting and worth categorizing as a piece of knowledge.

What this means for personality type theory includes the following: none of us ever only attend to a single function. They come in pairs, together, if we are to create knowledge from our experiences and from our analysis of those experience.

The are four different kinds of concepts:

* Extraverted Perceiving and Extraverted Judging

This pair is focused completely on the outside world and receives neither perceptions nor judgements from the inner world. It takes information in from the outside world and categorizes that information according to external criteria.

An example:

"I can see that this part of the machine is broken."

* Extraverted Perceiving and Introverted Judging

This pair receives information from the outside world and sorts it according to internal standards.

An example:

"I can see that this mistreatment of people is not right."

* Introverted Perceiving and Introverted Judging

This pair receives information from the inner world and judges it according to internal standards.

An example:

"I really enjoyed going to the theme park last weekend."


* Introverted Perceiving and Extraverted Judging

This pair receives information from the inner world and judges it according to external standards.

An example:

"That thing I did a long time ago, that didn't work for my career in the long run."
