# Cognitive Functions Are Dualistic

At the heart of the theory of Cognitive Functions is a dualism. There are two realms that make up reality. First, there is the concrete, physical world. Secondly, there is the abstract world of ideas. Since Cognitive Functions are primarily an attempt to describe how we pay attention to the world, it tells us our attention is divided. We can focus on the material world, or we can pay attention to ideas. It also helps us understand why we may be good at certain things and not so talented at other things.

** Confusion and The Mind-Body Problem

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines the [Mind-Body Problem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#MinBod):

> "The mind-body problem is the problem: what is the relationship between mind and body? Or alternatively: what is the relationship between mental properties and physical properties?" 

According to dualism, the realm of the mind it totally unlike that of the realm of the physical world. We find ourselves, as humans, caught between these two realms and must struggle with both in order to find our way in the world. Part of our job, as humans, is to define this relationship, clarify it, explain its structure and properties. That is a lifelong process. This process helps us figure out where we fit in the world, how to define ourselves, and how to best navigate within that world, with that knowledge of ourselves. The Mind-Body problem explains why this process is so difficult, and also how we can make progress towards healing that rift between mind and body.

## Abstract and Physical, Transcendental and Empirical

Kant usually uses terms like "transcendental" to refer to the abstract world, and "empirical" to refer to objects in the physical world. As he explains here, the capabilities of each:

> But there is one advantage in such transcendental inquiries, which can be made comprehensible to the dullest and most reluctant learner--this, namely, that the understanding which is occupied merely with empirical exercise, and does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition, may exercise its functions very well and very successfully, but is quite unable to do one thing, and that of very great importance, to determine, namely, the bounds that limit its employment, and to know what lies within or without its own sphere.

Those transcendental inquiries are those that ask about the limits of abstraction itself. It can only go so far. The empirical mode of engaging the world can use those abstractions to very effective use, but it isn't capable of questioning itself in the use of those abstractions.


> A transcendental use is made of a conception in a fundamental proposition or principle, when it is referred to things in general and considered as things in themselves; an empirical use, when it is referred merely to phenomena, that is, to objects of a possible experience.
