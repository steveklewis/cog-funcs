* Kant's Rule-Generating Principles

I would like to discuss a pattern that I observed in my reading of Kant's _Critique of Pure Reason_ (I will refer to it as "the Critique") and _Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals_ (I will refer to it as "the Groundwork"). In both, Kant discusses a specific principle and how that principle can generate rules. In the Groundwork, the topic of discussion is morality, whereas in the Critique, the topic of discussion is more epistemological in nature.

Let's review Kant's Categorical Imperative found in the Groundwork:

> Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." Groundwork, 52/421

What is interesting here is that there are no actual rules here. It's a principle for deciding which rules, or maxims, one should adopt. It is a principle by which one can generate rules for oneself. I found a similar`structure that in Kant's Critique:

> Transcendental philosophy has the advantage, and moreover the duty, of searching for its conceptions according to a principle; because these conceptions spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding as an absolute unity, and therefore must be connected with each other according to one conception or idea. A conception of this kind, however, furnishes us with a ready prepared rule, by which its proper place may be assigned to every pure conception of the understanding and the completeness of the system of all be determined *a priori*--both which would have been dependent on mere choice or chance.

Here, although the sphere is no longer ethics, but epistemology, Kant uses a similar structure. He adopts a principle that can generate conceptions, or rules, that define how we can know certain things.
