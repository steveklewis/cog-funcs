# The Inner Movement of the Mind - Introverted Thinking and Introverted Feeling

The active mind moves. There are two primary modes of movement for the mind. First, there is the movement of rationality. Second, there is the movement of existentiality. The first deals with the True. The second deals with the Good. What's strange about these two is that they directly compete with each other. We have to make tradeoffs, and so often we get stuck in one mode to the detriment of the other mode. These are errors of judgement of a larger scale, where not only can we not judge something accurately, but we're also using the wrong criteria to judge that something by.

## The Tradeoff of Consistency and Value

That first kind of judgement, regarding the True, is called Introverted Thinking. The second kind of judgement, regarding the Good, is called Introverted Feeling. Introverted Thinking allows me to relate one thing to another thing, and compare and contrast it. Its primary criterion is that of consistency. Something is true or false based on whether it is consistent with another thing or set of things. But as I compare two things in my mind, I lose focus on myself. As I stay within the realm of Introverted Thinking, I lose track of where I stand with that first thing. That ability to know where one stands is the realm of Introverted Feeling. Introverted Feeling allows me to relate one thing or person or idea, to myself. Introverted Feeling's primary criterion is that of value. Something is good or bad based on whether I find it valuable to me or not. But as I compare one thing with myself in my mind, I lose the ability to focus on the consistency between two things. And so I can focus on Introverted Feeling or Introverted Thinking, but I cannot focus on them both at the same time.

## The Inner Life of a Programmer

For me, I tend to use Introverted Thinking all the time while I'm at work. But I use Introverted Feeling in my personal life and at home. So I tend to make errors of logic at home, and errors related to significance at work. My mind wants to judge things as good or bad at work, when work demands that I put that aside and only judge whether something is true or not. Or sometimes I'm so tired from trying to be logical at work that I have no energy to be logical at home.

My attention is like a single CPU, that can only pay attention to one thing at once. So in order to get this balance right, I need to intelligently schedule time so that I can switch between the True and the Good at the appropriate time.

## Introverted Thinking and Introverted Feeling in Philosophy

Two examples of the two kinds of thinking are Hegel and Kierkegaard. Hegel's rationality wants to encompass everything, so nothing lies outside the system. Kierkegaard's response is that you can rationalize everything but the facts of existence cannot be contained.
