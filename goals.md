# Personal Goals and Cognitive Functions

Our goals are abstractions. We are not "there" yet. We haven't arrived at our destination. That is why I believe that goals ought to be categorized as instances of Introverted Intuition. Because they haven't happened yet, they can't be class with Introverted Sensing. Because they aren't happening right now, they can't be grouped as an Extraverted Sensation. And while a goal connects now to the future, as a possibility, a goal is much more stable than a possible path. It is a path in which we focus our mind's eye, to give us that stable goal, no matter what obstacles we meet or situations we find ourselves in.

The hardest part, but most necessary part, in defining a goal, is to answer the question: "What do I want?" Not, "What do other people want?", because that's Extraverted Feeling. And not, "What is good for me?", because that's Introverted Feeling. Those two questions are interesting questions, but when you are trying to define goals for yourself, it's an entirely different question to deal with what you want.

It requires a lot of clearing away the cobwebs of your habits, and the things you've gone along with, in order to survive as a member of society. This is where I believe Cognitive Functions can be especially helpful, when you are trying to get clarity on a particular question and you need to whittle things down to a single category. The answer to what one wants becomes the goal, and then you can analyze if it's a worthwhile goal, a good goal, if others might want the same goal, and if you might help others along the way in pursuit of your goal. But the first thing is to find the goal. It probably won't be your ultimate goal, but the process will help clarify what your next best step ought to be.

Because when you know what you want, it shines forth like a star in the sky to help keep you focused on your goal. Your goal is above you, ahead of you, but you've internalized it as a guiding force within you.
