# Introverted Intuition - Selecting the Software Strategy

Introverted Intuition is the category that defines the abstractions inherent in your system. There are many decisions that can be categorized as "architectural decisions" and that is the basic category of Introverted Intuition. Stuff like:

1. Language choice
1. Data model
1. Database
1. The killer feature of your app
1. The rules and if-statements in your app
1. The [non-functional requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) (e.g. Availability, Testability, Reliability, etc.)

These are the decisions that end up getting concretized in the artifacts. We perceieve them in our minds before we implement them, and we perceive them after the fact. Even if we've forgotten them a year later, the patterns are still there. 
Old abstract information.
