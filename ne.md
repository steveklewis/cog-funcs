# Extraverted Intuition - Path Generation in the Abstract World

When I was unsure if I wanted to continue as a programmer or not, the biggest thing that helped me, was to figure out what kind of creativity I had as a strength. The distinction between concrete and abstract creation made me realize that even if there were parts of software development that I didn't love, at a basic level it gave me a lot of freedom to create, abstractly. As ideas pop in and out of my imagination, I'm able to generate possible solutions, and run simulations, in my mind, until I find a solution. If there's anything I love to do, it's to stare at the ideas in my mind. And being a programmer affords me plenty of time to play with abstractions.

## Staying Focused on the Abstract World

According to Stack Overflow's [2019 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#work-_-greatest-challenges-to-productivity), the top three challenges to productivity are 1) distracting work environment, 2) meetings, and 3) being tasked with non-development work. All three of these things require a programmer to stop programming. Because that's what a coder loves most: to code. And the basis of that love is engagement with the abstract world.

We are creators in the abstract world. It is our stage. We juggle rules, data, and algorithms as we try to create a machine that matches the required behavior. When we sit down at the computer to program, from the outside it may look like we're not doing much. But in this pose our minds can soar to find solutions. We are receiving information from the abstract world via our imagination. We have a picture of the system in our minds and we are trying to figure out how to extend or modify it first in our minds, and then in the source code.

However, by itself, Extraverted Intuition will not select from a set of alternatives. All it can do is generate options. Once we have a new path, we can figure out if it's plausible by submitting it to one of our judging functions.


What I have learned from recognizing myself as an abstract creator is how to become willing to expand my set of skills, simply because they are also contained within the category of abstract creation. I used to hate writing. But I have become more willing to do it and enjoy the process of it much more than I used to. I have learned to see myself as a writer.






# Guessing with Extraverted Intuition

If you have conscious Extraverted Intuition, and unconscious Introverted Intuition, you have to guess. Here's how I use it every day as a programmer:

First, a new feature is required or a bug crops up. I have to figure out how I want to first set out, with very little information. Before I take that first step, I generate a set of alternatives for implementing the feature or patching the bug. I ask myself, "What could be the root cause of this bug?" I don't have enough information yet, and I will get more as I go along this process, but I need to start looking somewhere.


I could use Fi or Te to skim through each option and consider the probability of each one, and with Fi that's what I do, very quickly. But I know my first guess will probably be wrong, but I need a starting point so I can start collecting data.






Add "writer" as a role because of realization of abstract creation.
